**If we don't collect it, we can't leak it.**

This privacy policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. No legal theater, no hidden surprises — just the truth.

## Philosophy

We built this platform on a simple principle:

**"If we don't collect it, we can't leak it."**

We collect only what's necessary to deliver products. No hidden trackers, no data mining, no surveillance capitalism.

Your data is yours. We're just borrowing it long enough to deliver what you purchased.

That's it.
