# homepage emotional validation checklist

**design qa: does the homepage evoke the right emotions?**

---

## target emotions (employer)

employer should feel:

- [ ] **calm** — not overwhelmed, site feels stable
- [ ] **clarity** — understand who you are immediately
- [ ] **trust** — believe claims, see real proof
- [ ] **respect** — taken seriously, not sold to
- [ ] **light intrigue** — want to learn more (optional)

---

## anti-emotions (must NOT appear)

employer should NOT feel:

- [ ] **confusion** — "what does this person do?"
- [ ] **pressure** — "am i supposed to buy something?"
- [ ] **impressiveness anxiety** — "they're trying too hard"
- [ ] **"personal brand" energy** — "influencer vibes"

---

## operator validation (internal)

as site owner, ask yourself:

- [ ] "does this represent me accurately?"
- [ ] "am i trying too hard?"
- [ ] "would i be comfortable sending this to a serious employer without explanation?"

expected answers: yes, no, yes

## external validation process

### test with 3-5 employers/recruiters

**show homepage, wait 30-45 seconds, then ask:**

1. "what do you think this person does?"
   - expected: clear answer matching positioning

2. "have they built real things?"
   - expected: yes, can name at least one proof item

3. "would you consider them for a role?"
   - expected: yes or maybe (with specific reason)

4. "how do you feel after viewing this?"
   - expected: calm, clear, trusting
