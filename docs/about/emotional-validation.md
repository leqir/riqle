# About Page Emotional Validation Checklist

**Story 4.12: Emotional Validation Checks**

---

## Purpose

Validate that the About page produces the right emotional outcome:
**Employers feel reassurance and confidence, not pity or doubt.**

---

## Desired Emotions

When employers read the About page, they should feel:

✅ **Reassurance** — "This person's path makes sense"
✅ **Respect** — "They've done real work and learned from it"
✅ **Understanding** — "I see how they got here"
✅ **Confidence in judgment** — "They make thoughtful decisions"

---

## Anti-Emotions (Red Flags)

Employers should NOT feel:

❌ **Pity** — "They've had a rough time"
❌ **Confusion** — "Wait, what do they actually do?"
❌ **Doubt** — "Are they going to pivot again?"
❌ **"Why are they telling me this?"** — Over-sharing or defensiveness

---

## Pre-Launch Review

Before publishing, complete this self-assessment:

- [ ] Would I feel comfortable discussing this page in an interview?
- [ ] Does the page invite probing questions about my choices? (Should be NO)
- [ ] Does any section trigger pity, confusion, or doubt?
- [ ] Does the page produce reassurance and confidence?
- [ ] Is every pivot framed as data-driven, not emotional?
- [ ] Are all lessons specific and earned, not generic?
- [ ] Does the current focus feel practical, not aspirational?
- [ ] Are operating principles observable in my actual work?

## External Validation (3-5 Test Readers)

### Test Protocol

1. **Select 3-5 test readers**
   - Ideal: potential employers, recruiters, or hiring managers
   - Alternative: peers who can evaluate from employer perspective

2. **Ask them to read the page** (no context)

3. **Collect immediate reactions:**
   - "What emotions did you feel reading this?"
   - "Summarize this person's path in one sentence"
   - "Would you consider them for a role?"
   - "Do you have any concerns or follow-up questions?"

### Expected Responses

**Emotions:**

- Expected: reassurance, respect, understanding, confidence
- Red flags: pity, confusion, doubt, "why is he telling me this?"

**Summary:**

- Expected: Clear one-sentence trajectory (Student → Tutor → Builder → Founder)
- Red flags: Confusion, "I'm not sure", multiple interpretations

**Consideration:**

- Expected: Yes or Maybe (with specific reason)
- Red flags: No, or Yes but with caveats about stability

**Follow-up questions:**

- Expected: Role-specific questions about skills or current work
- Red flags: Questions about why you left previous roles, concerns about pivots

---

## Interview Simulation

### Protocol

1. **Read the page aloud to yourself**
2. **Ask after each section:**
   - Would I say this in an interview?
   - Does this feel defensive or over-explained?
   - Does this invite doubt or reassurance?

### Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Pass:** You would say this content verbatim in an interview
❌ **Fail:** Any hesitation, need to soften language, or "I'd explain it differently"

---

## Specific Section Validation

### Opening Context

- [ ] Feels current, not nostalgic?
- [ ] No childhood backstory?
- [ ] No credentials list?
- [ ] No future promises?

### Trajectory Timeline

- [ ] Each phase logically leads to the next?
- [ ] Pivots feel intentional, not erratic?
- [ ] No emotional language ("burnt out", "lost")?
- [ ] Lessons are specific, not generic?

### Current Focus

- [ ] Practical, not aspirational?
- [ ] Concrete, not vague?
- [ ] No grand mission statements?

### Operating Principles

- [ ] Observable in your actual work?
- [ ] Short and declarative, not explanatory?
- [ ] Lived-in, not aspirational?

---

## Common Failure Patterns

### 1. Over-explaining pivots

**Problem:** "I loved teaching, but after years of frustration..."
**Fix:** "After teaching 500+ students, I noticed that..."

### 2. Emotional residue

**Problem:** "It was a difficult decision to leave..."
**Fix:** Remove entirely. State what happened, not how you felt.

### 3. Defensive framing

**Problem:** "Some people might think X, but actually..."
**Fix:** Don't anticipate objections. Let the facts speak.

### 4. Generic lessons

**Problem:** "I learned a lot about teamwork and perseverance."
**Fix:** Be specific: "Teaching 500+ students taught me that clarity beats cleverness."

### 5. Aspirational language

**Problem:** "I'm passionate about transforming education..."
**Fix:** "Right now, I'm working on educational tools that..."

## Revision Protocol

If validation fails:

1. **Identify specific red flags**
   - Which sections triggered anti-emotions?
   - What questions did readers ask?
   - Where did you hesitate during interview simulation?

2. **Apply tone guide corrections**
   - Remove emotional language
   - Remove defensive framing
   - Remove over-explanations
   - Make lessons more specific

3. **Re-test**
   - Repeat validation with new readers
   - Continue until all checks pass

## Post-Launch Monitoring

- [ ] Track questions asked about trajectory
- [ ] Note any recurring concerns
- [ ] Update page if anti-emotions are detected

**Review cadence:** Quarterly or after any significant feedback

---

**Validation Status:** PENDING
**Next Step:** Complete external validation with 3-5 test readers before considering Epic 4 complete
