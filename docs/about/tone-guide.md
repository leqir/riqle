# About Page Tone Guide

**Story 4.2: Narrative Stance**

---

## Required Stance

The About page must read like considered professional reflection, not a personal essay.

✅ **Calm** — No urgency, no emotional peaks
✅ **Reflective** — Thoughtful, considered
✅ **Grounded** — Concrete, specific
✅ **Matter-of-fact** — Descriptive, not persuasive

---

## Explicitly NOT

❌ **Inspirational** — No hero's journey
❌ **Dramatic** — No emotional volatility
❌ **Defensive** — No justification of choices
❌ **Justificatory** — No retrofitted reasoning

---

## Core Distinction

### This is NOT

"Here's why my choices were right."

### This IS

"Here's what happened, what I learned, and how it informs what I do now."

---

## Banned Phrases

**Never use:**

- "I'm passionate about..."
- "burnt out", "lost", "struggled"
- "dream", "mission", "calling"
- Any retrospective justification
- "I decided to pivot because..."
- "It was a difficult decision, but..."
- "I realized I could have more impact by..."

---

## Good Examples

✅ "Tutoring revealed X, which later shaped Y."
✅ "Building Z exposed constraints I now design around."
✅ "Teaching 500+ students taught me that clarity beats cleverness—most comprehension failures come from unnecessary complexity, not lack of intelligence."
✅ "After teaching 500+ students, I noticed that the tools available for [problem] were inadequate. Building MarkPoint was a response to that gap."

---

## Bad Examples

❌ "I was passionate about education and wanted to make a difference."
❌ "After burning out, I pivoted to tech."
❌ "I loved teaching, but after years of frustration with the system, I realized I needed to make a change."
❌ "It was a difficult decision, but ultimately I knew I could have more impact by building tools."

## Testing Tone

After writing, ask:

1. **Calm test:** Does any sentence create urgency or emotional peaks?
2. **Reflection test:** Does it feel thoughtful or rushed?
3. **Grounding test:** Is every claim concrete and specific?
4. **Matter-of-fact test:** Am I describing or persuading?

If any answer fails, rewrite.

## Tone in Practice

### Opening Context

- Present tense only
- What you do now, not what you used to do
- Concrete problems, not abstract missions

### Trajectory Timeline

- Cause-and-effect, not chronology
- Learning focus, not status focus
- No emotional language about transitions

### Current Focus

- Practical, not aspirational
- Bounded, not infinite
- Specific problems, not vague ambitions

### Operating Principles

- Observable, not aspirational
- Short, not explanatory
- Lived-in, not theoretical

---

## Expected Emotional Response

**Readers should feel:**

- Reassurance
- Respect
- Understanding
- Confidence in judgment

**Readers should NOT feel:**

- Pity
- Confusion
- Doubt
- "Why are they telling me this?"

---

## Validation Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Read entire page aloud—does any sentence sound defensive?
- [ ] Would you say this content verbatim in an interview?
- [ ] Does the page invite probing questions about your choices? (Should be NO)
- [ ] Does any section trigger pity, confusion, or doubt?
- [ ] Does the page produce reassurance and confidence?

---

## Editorial Review Protocol

1. **Self-review:** Read aloud, flag anything that sounds defensive
2. **Peer review:** 2-3 people read, ask: "What emotions did you feel?"
3. **Interview simulation:** Would you say this in an interview?
4. **Remove flagged content:** Delete anything that fails tone requirements

**Tone Status:** ENFORCED
**Review Cadence:** Before any About page content updates
