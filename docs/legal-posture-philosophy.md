# Legal Posture Philosophy

## Principles

### 1. Do what's required, not what's theatrical
- Include only legally necessary terms
- No copy-pasted legal walls from templates
- Every clause must be understood and defensible

### 2. Plain language over legal intimidation
- Write for normal people, not lawyers
- Explain consequences clearly
- No aggressive disclaimers

### 3. Accuracy over breadth
- Reflect how the site actually works
- Update when reality changes
- No overclaiming protections

## Explicit Bans

- Copy-pasted legal templates you don't understand
- "We are not responsible for anything" language
- Overly aggressive liability disclaimers
- Legal jargon when plain English works
- Claims you can't defend publicly

## Decision Framework

When adding legal content, ask:

1. **Is this legally required?** (Yes = include, No = skip)
2. **Can I explain this to a friend?** (No = rewrite in plain language)
3. **Does this reflect reality?** (No = update reality or policy)
4. **Would I feel comfortable defending this publicly?** (No = remove or revise)

## Tone Standard

Legal content should feel: **Quiet, precise, and boring.**

NOT: Threatening, confusing, or theatrical.
