# Framing Paused/Incomplete Startups

**Epic 6 - Story 6.5**

## Purpose
Frame paused or incomplete startups honestly without defensiveness, demonstrating decision-making maturity rather than instability.

---

## Core Principle

**Paused projects should increase trust, not raise doubt.**

Employers want to see that you can:
- Start initiatives responsibly
- Evaluate progress objectively
- Stop or pivot based on data
- Learn from outcomes

---

## Required Framing Elements

### 1. State Status Plainly

Use matter-of-fact language without apology:

**Good Examples:**
- "Currently paused while I focus on X"
- "Active but iterating based on user feedback"
- "Sunset after validating that Y approach wasn't viable"
- "Paused after 6 months of testing with 50 users"

**Bad Examples (avoid):**
- "Unfortunately, I had to pause..." (apologetic)
- "I wish I could have continued but..." (defensive)
- "Due to circumstances beyond my control..." (victim framing)

### 2. Explain Constraints Honestly

Provide specific, data-driven constraints:

**Good Examples:**
- "User acquisition costs exceeded sustainable unit economics"
- "Technical constraints required a rebuild I couldn't justify"
- "Market validation showed limited demand for this approach"
- "After testing with 50 users, retention was 10% vs. target of 40%"
- "Time required to reach profitability exceeded available runway"

**Bad Examples (avoid):**
- "I didn't have enough time" (vague)
- "The market wasn't ready" (blame-shifting)
- "I ran out of money" (without context)
- "It was too hard" (weak framing)

### 3. Emphasize Decisions, Not Excuses

Focus on what you decided and why:

**Good Examples:**
- "I decided to pause rather than scale prematurely"
- "After testing with 50 users, I pivoted to Z based on feedback"
- "I chose to sunset this and apply learnings to project X"
- "Data showed approach wasn't viable; I validated the learning and moved on"

**Bad Examples (avoid):**
- "I had to stop because..." (passive framing)
- "Things didn't work out" (vague)
- "Life got in the way" (excuse)

## Status Categories & Framing

### Active
**Meaning:** Currently operating with users

**Framing Template:**
"Active. Currently serving [X users], iterating on [specific focus] based on feedback."

**Example:**
"Active. Currently serving 500 students, iterating on retention based on user feedback that highlighted onboarding complexity."

### Iterating
**Meaning:** Live but undergoing significant changes

**Framing Template:**
"Iterating. [What's working], but [what needs improvement]. Currently testing [specific approach]."

**Example:**
"Iterating. Users value the feedback quality, but acquisition costs are too high. Currently testing content-driven growth instead of paid ads."

### Paused
**Meaning:** Stopped operations, may resume

**Framing Template:**
"Paused. After [timeframe/data], [constraint identified]. Applying learnings to [current focus]."

**Example:**
"Paused. After 6 months with 100 users, retention was 15% vs. 40% target. Core assumption about user motivation was wrong. Applying learnings to current work on engagement systems."

### Sunset
**Meaning:** Permanently stopped

**Framing Template:**
"Sunset. [Constraint or validation]. [Learning] informs [current work]."

**Example:**
"Sunset. User acquisition costs ($50/user) exceeded lifetime value ($30). Validated that B2C education requires viral mechanics or institutional partnerships. This informs how I evaluate distribution for future products."

## Tone Guidelines

### ✅ Use This Tone:
- **Matter-of-fact:** State facts without emotional overlay
- **Data-driven:** Cite specific metrics or observations
- **Decision-focused:** Emphasize what you decided, not what happened to you
- **Learning-oriented:** Connect outcomes to current work

### ❌ Avoid This Tone:
- **Apologetic:** "I'm sorry this didn't work out..."
- **Defensive:** "If only I had more time/money/help..."
- **Romanticizing struggle:** "It was really hard, but I learned so much..."
- **Blame-shifting:** "The market wasn't ready..."
- **Vague:** "Things didn't go as planned..."

## Content Review Checklist

Before publishing content about a paused/incomplete startup, verify:

- [ ] **Status is stated plainly**
  - No hedging, no apology
  - Clear category: Active, Iterating, Paused, or Sunset

- [ ] **Constraints are specific**
  - Data-driven (metrics, user feedback, costs)
  - Not vague ("time", "resources")
  - Not blame-shifting ("market", "luck")

- [ ] **Decisions are emphasized**
  - What you decided to do/not do
  - Why you made that decision
  - What you learned from the outcome

- [ ] **Tone is matter-of-fact**
  - No emotional language
  - No defensiveness
  - No apology

- [ ] **Learning connects to current work**
  - Specific lesson articulated
  - Connection to current skills/focus clear
  - Demonstrates growth, not failure

## Trust Test

For each paused/incomplete startup, ask:

1. **Does this increase or decrease trust?**
   - If decrease: revise framing or remove entirely

2. **Does this demonstrate decision-making maturity?**
   - If no: add specific decisions and rationale

3. **Would I feel comfortable explaining this in an interview?**
   - If no: either strengthen framing or archive

4. **Is the tone matter-of-fact?**
   - If no: remove emotional or defensive language

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Paused Marketplace

**Before (defensive):**
"Unfortunately, I had to pause this project due to lack of time and resources. The market wasn't ready for this approach, but I learned a lot about building marketplaces."

**After (matter-of-fact):**
"Paused. After 4 months with 200 signups but only 15 transactions, supply-side activation was 5% vs. 30% target. Building two-sided marketplaces requires focusing on one side first—a lesson I now apply to all network-effect products."

### Example 2: Sunset SaaS Tool

**Before (vague):**
"Things didn't work out for this project, but it was a great learning experience."

**After (specific):**
"Sunset. Users reported value (NPS: 45) but wouldn't pay ($99/mo vs. $19 willingness). Validated that pain point wasn't acute enough to justify premium pricing. This informs how I evaluate problem severity before building."

### Example 3: Active but Struggling

**Before (apologetic):**
"I'm still working on this, but progress has been slower than expected due to various challenges."

**After (honest):**
"Iterating. 100 active users with 25% weekly retention. Testing new onboarding flow to address drop-off point identified in user interviews. Retention is the constraint; working methodically to solve it."

## Interview Preparation

For each paused/incomplete startup, prepare to answer:

1. **"Why did you start this?"**
   - Problem you identified
   - Validation that led you to build

2. **"What was your role exactly?"**
   - What you owned
   - What you decided
   - What you built

3. **"What didn't work?"**
   - Specific constraint or failure
   - Data that showed the problem
   - Decision you made as a result

4. **"Would you do it again?"**
   - What you'd do differently
   - What you'd keep the same
   - How this informs current work

If you can't answer these confidently, revise the framing or archive the startup.

## Summary

**Good framing of paused/incomplete startups:**
- Increases trust by showing mature decision-making
- Demonstrates data-driven thinking
- Shows ability to evaluate and pivot
- Proves you can start, assess, and stop responsibly

**Bad framing:**
- Raises doubt through defensiveness
- Suggests inability to finish
- Feels like excuse-making
- Lacks learning or growth
