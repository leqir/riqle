# Employer Perception Audit Checklist

**Epic 8 - Story 8.11**

## Purpose
Provide a systematic audit checklist to ensure the Resources section enhances (rather than undermines) professional credibility with employers. Use this before launch and annually to verify employer-safe presentation.

---

## Core Question

**"If I shared my screen showing /resources in a job interview, would I be proud of every visible element?"**

If the answer is yes for every element, the Resources section passes.
If the answer is no for any element, that element must be revised.
