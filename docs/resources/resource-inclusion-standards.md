# Resource Inclusion Standards

**Epic 8 - Story 8.3**

## Purpose
Define strict inclusion standards for educational resources to ensure every product is defensible, based on real experience, and protects trust.

## Core Principle

**If you wouldn't recommend it to family without being paid, it doesn't belong.**

Every resource must:
- Be defensible in an interview
- Be based on real teaching experience (500+ students)
- Solve a specific, validated problem
- Meet a quality bar you'd be proud of in 5 years

## Explicit Exclusions

### ❌ Generic Productivity Content

**Not allowed:**
- Generic time management tips
- General study skills not HSC-specific
- Motivational content
- Productivity hacks
- Generic essay writing (not HSC-focused)

**Why excluded:** Not based on your specific expertise (HSC English tutoring). Dilutes credibility.

### ❌ Low-Effort PDFs Without Substance

**Not allowed:**
- Quickly assembled content for revenue
- Repurposed blog posts as "guides"
- Generic templates with minimal instruction
- Checklists without context or teaching
- Summary sheets without frameworks

**Why excluded:** Undermines trust. If quality bar is low, all products are suspect.

**Quality test:** Would this resource alone help a student improve? If no, it doesn't belong.

### ❌ Anything You Wouldn't Recommend to Family

**Not allowed:**
- Products you have doubts about
- Content you're not fully confident in
- Resources that might not deliver value
- Materials you'd be embarrassed to discuss

**Why excluded:** If you wouldn't enthusiastically recommend it for free to family, you shouldn't sell it to strangers.

**The family test:** "Would I give this to my cousin preparing for HSC and feel good about it?"

### ❌ Products Created Purely for Revenue

**Not allowed:**
- Creating products because "there's demand"
- Filling gaps in product lineup for revenue
- Launching because "everyone has 3+ products"
- Building because you need another income stream

**Why excluded:** Revenue-first thinking leads to quality compromise. Only create when you have something genuinely useful to share.

### ❌ Generic Templates from Other Sources

**Not allowed:**
- Adapting templates from other teachers
- Repackaging generic essay structures
- Using content not created from your experience
- Templates not tested with your students

**Why excluded:** Not your intellectual property. Not based on your experience. Can't defend in detail.
