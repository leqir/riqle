# Pricing Philosophy

**Epic 8 - Story 8.6**

## Purpose
Establish clear principles for pricing educational resources fairly and transparently, ensuring pricing decisions are defensible to all three audiences: employers, students, and operator.

---

## Core Principle

**Price what it's worth, not what you can extract.**

Every price should be:
- Defensible in an interview
- Fair to students (value matches cost)
- Comfortable for operator (no guilt or defensiveness)
- Based on clear value, not market manipulation

---

## Three-Audience Pricing Test

### Employer Perspective
**Question:** "If a hiring manager asks why you charged $X, can you explain it comfortably?"

✅ **Pass:**
- "Based on 20+ hours development plus years of teaching refinement"
- "Priced at what I'd pay for this value"
- "Comparable to tutoring session but reusable"

❌ **Fail:**
- Can't justify price rationally
- Based on "what the market will bear"
- Defensive about pricing
- Priced high because "everyone else does"

### Student Perspective
**Question:** "Does a student understand what they're paying for and why?"

✅ **Pass:**
- Price reflects clear deliverables
- Student can evaluate value before purchase
- Fair compared to alternatives (tutoring, other resources)
- Transparent (no hidden costs or upsells)

❌ **Fail:**
- Price seems disconnected from value
- Unclear what justifies the cost
- Feels expensive for what's delivered
- Requires upsells to get full value

### Operator Perspective
**Question:** "Would you feel comfortable if your cousin bought this at this price?"

✅ **Pass:**
- Genuinely believe it's worth the price
- Would recommend at this price without being paid
- No guilt or defensiveness
- Proud of value provided

❌ **Fail:**
- Feel guilty about the price
- Wouldn't recommend to family at this price
- Defensive when discussing pricing
- Know it's overpriced but charge anyway

## Pricing Methodology

### Step 1: Calculate Floor Price (Minimum Viable)

**Formula:**
```
Floor Price = (Development Hours × Hourly Rate) ÷ Expected Sales
```

**Example:**
- Development: 40 hours
- Hourly rate: $50/hour (conservative)
- Expected sales: 50 students
- Floor price: (40 × $50) ÷ 50 = **$40**

**This is the minimum to justify time invested.**

### Step 2: Calculate Value Price (What It's Worth)

**Question:** What would a student pay for this value through other means?

**Comparison Anchors:**
1. **Tutoring sessions:**
   - 1 tutoring session: $50-80/hour
   - Resource equivalent to how many sessions?

2. **Time saved:**
   - Hours of research/trial-and-error prevented
   - Multiply by student's value of time

3. **Outcome value:**
   - HSC Band 6 impact
   - University admission value
   - Confidence/stress reduction

**Example:**
- Resource saves 5 hours of trial-and-error
- Equivalent to 2 tutoring sessions
- Value price: **$80-100**

### Step 3: Set Fair Price (Between Floor and Value)

**Formula:**
```
Fair Price = Floor Price + (Value Price - Floor Price) × Confidence Factor
```

**Confidence Factor:**
- 0.3-0.5: New product, unproven
- 0.5-0.7: Tested with 10-20 students
- 0.7-1.0: Proven with 50+ students, strong track record

**Example:**
- Floor: $40
- Value: $90
- Confidence: 0.6 (tested with 15 students)
- Fair price: $40 + ($90 - $40) × 0.6 = **$70**

**Round to clean number:** $69 or $75 (avoid $69.99 tricks)

### Step 4: Three-Audience Validation

Before finalizing, test against all three perspectives:

- [ ] **Employer:** Can I defend this price in an interview?
- [ ] **Student:** Is this price fair for the value delivered?
- [ ] **Operator:** Would I recommend this to family at this price?

**If any answer is "no," adjust price or improve value.**

## Forbidden Pricing Tactics

### ❌ Artificial Discounting
**Not allowed:**
- "Was $199, now $99!"
- Fake original prices
- Permanent "sales"
- "Early bird" pricing that never ends

**Why forbidden:** Manipulative, undermines trust

### ❌ Tiered Upselling
**Not allowed:**
- Basic/Pro/Premium tiers
- "Unlock full version for $X more"
- Feature gating to force upgrades
- "Add-ons" required for completeness

**Why forbidden:** Feels like SaaS manipulation, not education

### ❌ Scarcity Manipulation
**Not allowed:**
- "Only 5 spots left!"
- Artificial enrollment limits
- "Price increases tomorrow"
- Countdown timers

**Why forbidden:** Creates pressure, undermines calm evaluation

### ❌ Anchoring Tricks
**Not allowed:**
- "$997 value, yours for $97"
- Inflated "total value" calculations
- Comparison to irrelevant high prices
- "Worth 10 tutoring sessions" (unless literally true)

**Why forbidden:** Manipulative framing

---

## Allowed Pricing Communication

### ✅ Transparent Explanation
**Allowed:**
- "Priced at $75 based on 40 hours development"
- "Equivalent value to 2 tutoring sessions"
- "Tested with 50+ students before release"

---

## Bundle Pricing

### When to Offer Bundles
**Good reasons:**
- Multiple resources work together as system
- Students naturally use these together
- Provides genuine convenience and savings

**Bad reasons:**
- Increase average transaction value
- Make individual products seem cheaper
- Complexity for complexity's sake

### Bundle Discount Formula
```
Bundle Price = Sum of Individual Prices × 0.8
```

**Example:**
- Essay Framework: $45
- Text Analysis: $65
- Exam Prep: $75
- Total: $185
- Bundle: $185 × 0.8 = **$148** (20% savings)

**Rule:** Bundle discount must be real, not fake. Individual prices must be fair standalone.

## Pricing Review Schedule

### Annual Review (Every 12 Months)

**Questions to ask:**
1. **Has development improved?**
   - Added content or refinement?
   - More student testing?
   - Better outcomes data?

2. **Has value changed?**
   - Are students getting better results?
   - Does it save more time than before?
   - Have alternatives changed?

3. **Is current price still fair?**
   - Would I pay this price for this value?
   - Can I still defend it comfortably?
   - Would I recommend to family at this price?

**Actions:**
- **Increase price:** Only if value genuinely increased (content added, outcomes improved)
- **Decrease price:** If value hasn't matched original expectations
- **Maintain price:** If value remains consistent

**Grandfather Rule:** Existing customers never pay more for updates.

### Mid-Cycle Adjustment (Only if Necessary)

**When to adjust mid-cycle:**
- Significant value decrease (content becomes outdated)
- Major value increase (substantial content added)
- Found pricing error (significantly mis-priced)

**How to adjust:**
- Decrease: Immediate, refund recent purchases difference
- Increase: Announce 30 days in advance, grandfather existing customers

---

## Refund Philosophy

### 14-Day No-Questions Refund
**Why:**
- Students can evaluate risk-free
- Signals confidence in quality
- Builds trust (not extractive)
- Simplifies support

### Refund Rate as Quality Signal

**Target refund rate:** <5%

**If refund rate >5%:**
- Indicates quality or clarity issue
- Review product against inclusion standards
- Consider updating or retiring
- Not a pricing problem (don't lower price to reduce refunds)

**If refund rate <2%:**
- Suggests pricing may be too low
- Or product quality is exceptional
- Consider price increase if value supports it

---

## Currency & Regional Pricing

### Primary Currency: AUD
**Why:**
- Based in Australia
- Primary market is Australian HSC students
- Simplifies accounting and tax

### No Regional Pricing Manipulation
**Not allowed:**
- Different prices for different countries (unless currency conversion)
- "Student discounts" based on location
- Geo-targeted pricing

**Why forbidden:** Feels manipulative, adds complexity

**Allowed:**
- Currency conversion (AUD → USD, etc.)
- Transparent about currency used
- One price globally (after conversion)

---

## Price Communication Examples

### ✅ Good Examples

**On listing page:**
```
HSC Essay Framework – $69
Format: PDF + Worksheets
```

**On detail page:**
```
Price: A$69

Why this price:
This resource represents 40+ hours of development,
refined through teaching 500+ students. It's priced
at less than one tutoring session but provides a
reusable framework you can apply to every essay.

14-day refund, no questions asked.
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

**Manipulative:**
```
🔥 NORMALLY $299 – TODAY ONLY $69! 🔥
Only 3 spots left at this price!
[Countdown Timer: 23:59:47]
```

**Over-explained:**
```
Price: $69

This represents just $0.23 per page! That's less
than a coffee! If you tutored for this, you'd pay
$500+. I'm basically giving this away! The total
value is $997 but I'm offering it for...
```

## Summary

**Pricing philosophy:**

1. **Defensible:** Can explain rationally to employers
2. **Fair:** Students get value matching cost
3. **Comfortable:** Operator feels no guilt or defensiveness
4. **Transparent:** Clear what price is and why
5. **Honest:** No manipulation, tricks, or false urgency

**The test:**
Would you explain this pricing proudly in a job interview, defend it to a student, and recommend it to family—all at the same time?

If yes, pricing is correct.
If no, adjust price or improve value.

**Remember:**
Better to charge fairly and sleep well than extract revenue and feel defensive.
