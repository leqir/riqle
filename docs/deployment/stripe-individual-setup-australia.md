## Why NOT to Use Markpoint Details

**DO NOT use another business's details (like Markpoint) because:**

1. **It's Fraud** - Even if unintentional, using false business information is fraud
2. **Wrong Bank Account** - Payments would go to Markpoint's bank, not yours
3. **Tax Problems** - Income would be reported under their ABN, causing tax issues for both parties
4. **Stripe Violation** - Against Stripe's Terms of Service (account will be terminated)
5. **Legal Liability** - You could be held personally liable for misrepresentation
6. **No Protection** - If there are disputes/chargebacks, you have no legal standing

---

## How This Affects Your Taxes

As an individual/sole trader:

1. **Income**: Report all Riqle sales on your personal tax return
   - Add to your "Business and professional items" section
   - Stripe will provide transaction reports

2. **Expenses**: You can claim business expenses:
   - Hosting costs (Vercel, etc.)
   - Domain registration
   - Software subscriptions
   - Home office portion (if applicable)
   - Stripe fees

3. **GST**:
   - If you earn less than $75,000/year → No GST registration needed
   - If you earn more → Must register for GST (still free)

4. **Keep Records**:
   - Bank statements
   - Stripe payout reports
   - Receipts for expenses
   - Simple spreadsheet is fine
