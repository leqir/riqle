# Commerce Governance

**Epic 8 - Story 8.12**

## Purpose

## Decision-Making Framework

### Product Creation Decision

**Question:** Should we create this resource?

**Process:**
1. Read `resource-inclusion-standards.md`
2. Complete the inclusion checklist (ALL criteria must pass)
3. If any criteria fail → Don't create product
4. If all pass → Proceed to pricing

**Escalation:** If uncertain about any criteria, default to NOT creating

### Pricing Decision

**Question:** What should we charge?

**Process:**
1. Read `pricing-philosophy.md`
2. Calculate floor price (minimum viable)
3. Calculate value price (what it's worth)
4. Set fair price between floor and value
5. Run three-audience test (employer, student, operator)
6. If any audience uncomfortable → Adjust or don't sell

**Escalation:** If can't defend price comfortably → Don't sell at that price

### Product Update Decision

**Question:** Should we update this product or retire it?

**Process:**
1. Review against current `resource-inclusion-standards.md`
2. Check refund rate (<5% target)
3. Run `employer-perception-audit.md` on product
4. Ask: "Would I recommend this to family today?"
5. If passes all → Update pricing if needed, keep published
6. If fails any → Archive or significantly improve

**Escalation:** If quality has declined → Archive immediately

### Commerce Feature Decision

**Question:** Should we add this commerce feature (bundle, subscription, etc.)?

**Process:**
1. Read `commerce-containment-rules.md`
2. Check: Does this violate any containment rules?
3. Read `three-audience-success-criteria.md`
4. Ask: Does this create tension between any audience?
5. If any violation or tension → Don't add feature
6. If passes → Design per `commerce-ux-guidelines.md`

**Escalation:** Default to NOT adding features unless clear benefit

## Annual Review Process

### Schedule: January each year

**Purpose:** Systematic review of all products and commerce elements

### Step 1: Product Quality Review (Week 1)

**For each published product:**

1. **Inclusion Standards Check**
   - [ ] Still based on current teaching experience?
   - [ ] Would still recommend to family without being paid?
   - [ ] Still defensible in job interview?
   - [ ] Quality still holds up?

2. **Refund Rate Check**
   - [ ] Refund rate still <5%?
   - [ ] Any patterns in refund reasons?
   - [ ] Quality issues indicated?

3. **Content Currency Check**
   - [ ] HSC syllabus still current?
   - [ ] Examples still relevant?
   - [ ] Approach still valid?

4. **Decision:**
   - **Keep:** Passes all checks
   - **Update:** Minor improvements needed

   - [ ] Comfortable discussing all products?
   - [ ] Commerce enhances credibility?

2. **Student Perspective**
   - [ ] Can students evaluate calmly?
   - [ ] Pricing fair and transparent?
   - [ ] Refund process welcoming?

3. **Operator Perspective**

## Ongoing Monitoring

### Monthly Checks (First Monday of Month)

## Drift Prevention

### Common Drift Patterns (Watch For These)

#### 1. Urgency Creep
**What it looks like:**
- "Limited spots" messaging appears
- Countdown timers introduced
- "Sale ends soon" language

**Prevention:**
- Ban these phrases explicitly in codebase comments
- Code review checks for urgency patterns
- Monthly language audit

**If detected:** Remove immediately, review how it got through

#### 2. Homepage Commerce Leak
**What it looks like:**
- "Latest products" section on homepage
- Product cards in sidebar
- Pricing visible on non-Resources pages

**Prevention:**
- Strict routing (commerce only in /resources)
- Code review for cross-contamination
- Monthly homepage check

**If detected:** Remove immediately, enforce separation

#### 3. Quality Decline
**What it looks like:**
- Refund rate increases (>5%)
- Shorter development time for new products
- Products created for revenue, not value

**Prevention:**
- Inclusion checklist required for all new products
- Minimum development time tracked
- Family recommendation test mandatory

**If detected:** Archive low-quality products immediately

#### 4. Hype Language Introduction
**What it looks like:**
- "Transform your grades" messaging
- "Revolutionary" or "game-changing" language
- Superlative claims ("best", "ultimate")

**Prevention:**
- Banned language list in style guide
- Content review before publishing
- Quarterly language audit

**If detected:** Rewrite immediately to informational tone

#### 5. Pricing Manipulation
**What it looks like:**
- Artificial discounts ("was $X, now $Y")
- Tiered upselling (Basic/Pro/Premium)
- Fake scarcity pricing

**Prevention:**
- Pricing philosophy review before any price change
- Code review prevents strikethrough prices
- Monthly pricing integrity check

**If detected:** Revert to clean pricing immediately

## Escalation Criteria

### When to Pause Commerce Immediately

**Automatic pause if:**
1. Refund rate >10% for any product (quality issue)
2. Negative feedback pattern (3+ similar complaints)
3. Would be embarrassed if employer found out
4. Containment violation on homepage
5. Support volume exceeds capacity

**Pause means:**
- Set all products to `published: false`

**Retirement process:**
1. Set `published: false` in database
2. Refund any purchases in last 30 days
3. Document reason in `archived-products.md`

### When to Seek External Validation

**Get external input if:**
1. Considering significant pricing change (>20%)
2. Adding new product category
3. Refund rate 5-10% (borderline)
4. Unsure about product quality
5. Contemplating new commerce features

**Process:**
- Show to 3-5 hiring managers
- Get student feedback (if possible)

❌ **Cannot delegate:**
- Product quality decisions (keep/update/retire)
- Pricing decisions (must pass three-audience test)

2. Public negative feedback (social media, reviews)
3. Employer discovers resources and has concerns
4. Reputational risk to professional identity

### Crisis Response Process

**Immediate (0-4 hours):**
1. Pause all commerce (set products to unpublished)
2. Process all pending refunds immediately
3. Assess scope of issue

**Short-term (4-24 hours):**
1. Identify root cause
2. Document what went wrong
3. Develop fix plan
4. Implement governance improvements

**Medium-term (1-7 days):**
1. Fix root cause comprehensively
2. Update governance documents
3. Run full employer perception audit
4. Seek external validation

**Long-term (1-4 weeks):**
1. Resume commerce only when passing all audits
2. Monitor closely for recurrence
3. Document lessons learned
4. Strengthen prevention

## Governance Evolution

### When to Update Governance Documents

**Update if:**
1. Discover gap in current guidelines
2. New drift pattern emerges
3. Annual review reveals systematic issues
4. External feedback suggests improvements
5. HSC curriculum changes significantly

**Process:**
1. Identify specific gap
2. Draft governance update
3. Test update against existing products
4. Implement and document rationale

**Version control:** Track major updates with dates

### Governance Improvement Suggestions

**After each annual review, ask:**
- What governance gaps were discovered this year?
- What drift patterns should we prevent?
- What decisions were difficult (need clearer framework)?
- What external feedback should inform updates?

**Document suggestions in `governance-improvements.md`**

## Summary

**Commerce governance ensures:**

1. **Quality:** All products meet high standards continuously
2. **Integrity:** Pricing and presentation remain defensible
3. **Containment:** Commerce never dominates site identity
4. **Professionalism:** Employer-safe at all times
5. **Trust:** Students feel respected, not manipulated

**Governance schedule:**

- **Monthly:** Quick health check (refund rate, support, spot-check)
- **Quarterly:** Deeper review (quality, feedback, UX)
- **Annually:** Comprehensive audit (products, pricing, perception)
- **Ongoing:** Drift vigilance, decision frameworks

**The ultimate test:**
Can you proudly discuss Resources section in any job interview, recommend all products to family, and sleep well at night?

If yes, governance is working.
If no, governance has failed—pause and fix.

**Remember:**
Governance exists to protect integrity, not to create bureaucracy.
