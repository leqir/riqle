# Metrics & Outcomes Guidelines (Startups)

**Epic 6 - Story 6.6**

## Purpose
Include meaningful metrics without hype, ensuring employers understand reality rather than inflated claims.

---

## Core Principle

**Metrics should clarify scope, not inflate importance.**

Employers want to understand:
- Scale of operation
- Type of users
- Real outcomes
- Honest assessment

They don't want:
- Vanity metrics
- Hype language
- Aspirational projections
- Bragging

---

## Acceptable Metrics

### ✅ Users Onboarded
**Format:** "[Number] [user type] [timeframe]"

**Good Examples:**
- "500 students onboarded in 6 months"
- "100 paying customers"
- "50 active users (from 200 signups)"

**Why acceptable:**
- Clarifies scale
- Shows real usage
- Indicates user type

### ✅ Revenue (if meaningful scale)
**Format:** "$[amount] [frequency/context]"

**Good Examples:**
- "$5K MRR from 100 paying customers"
- "$20K total revenue over 12 months"
- "$500 first-month revenue (validated willingness to pay)"

**Why acceptable:**
- Shows business viability
- Provides economic context
- Demonstrates monetization

**When to omit:**
- Revenue is negligible (<$100/mo)
- One-time or anomalous
- Doesn't represent sustainable model

### ✅ Work Completed
**Format:** "[Quantity] [work type] [context]"

**Good Examples:**
- "2,000+ essays marked"
- "500 feedback reports delivered"
- "100 students completed full program"

**Why acceptable:**
- Shows operational scale
- Clarifies value delivered
- Demonstrates execution

### ✅ Retention or Engagement
**Format:** "[Percentage] [metric type]"

**Good Examples:**
- "40% weekly active retention"
- "3 essays per student per month (avg)"
- "25% return rate within 30 days"

**Why acceptable:**
- Shows product-market fit signal
- Indicates value delivery
- More meaningful than raw signups

### ✅ Conversion or Efficiency
**Format:** "[Percentage] [conversion type]"

**Good Examples:**
- "10% signup → paying customer"
- "60% completed onboarding"
- "85% satisfaction score (NPS)"

**Why acceptable:**
- Shows system effectiveness
- Demonstrates quality
- Contextualizes other metrics

---

## Metrics to Avoid

### ❌ Vanity Metrics
**Examples:**
- "10,000 signups" (if 95% never used product)
- "1 million page views" (without conversion or engagement)
- "100 countries" (if only 10 active users)

**Why avoid:**
- Inflates perceived success
- Raises skepticism
- Doesn't clarify value delivered

### ❌ Aspirational Metrics
**Examples:**
- "Projected to reach $100K ARR next quarter"
- "On track to 10x growth"
- "Expected to serve 10,000 users by year-end"

**Why avoid:**
- Not reality, just hope
- Triggers skepticism
- Feels like pitching, not reporting

### ❌ Hype Language
**Examples:**
- "Explosive growth!"
- "Viral adoption!"
- "Crushing it with 10x month-over-month!"

**Why avoid:**
- Sounds like marketing
- Undermines credibility
- Contradicts professional record tone

### ❌ Relative Metrics Without Context
**Examples:**
- "Grew 500% last month" (from 2 to 10 users)
- "Doubled revenue" (from $50 to $100)
- "10x engagement" (without absolute numbers)

**Why avoid:**
- Misleading without base numbers
- Appears manipulative
- Raises doubt about other claims

## Guidelines

### 1. Only Include If It Informs Understanding
**Question:** Does this metric help employers understand scope, impact, or outcomes?

**Include:**
- "500 students onboarded" (shows scale)
- "40% retention" (shows product quality)
- "$5K MRR" (shows economic viability)

**Omit:**
- "Featured in 3 blogs" (vanity)
- "500 Twitter followers" (irrelevant)
- "10 beta testers" (doesn't add signal)

### 2. Use Ranges If Exact Numbers Aren't Appropriate
**When exact numbers feel like bragging or are outdated:**

**Good Examples:**
- "Several hundred active users"
- "Low thousands in MRR"
- "Dozens of paying customers"

**When to use:**
- Exact number feels performative
- Metrics are fluctuating
- Precision isn't important to story

### 3. Omit Metrics If You Don't Have Meaningful Data
**It's better to have no metrics than weak ones.**

**When to omit entirely:**
- Product is too new (< 50 users)
- Metrics are negative or meaningless
- Numbers don't support narrative

**What to say instead:**
- Focus on qualitative outcomes
- Emphasize systems built
- Highlight learnings

### 4. Add Context to Raw Numbers
**Context makes metrics meaningful.**

**Without context (weak):**
- "500 users"
- "$5K revenue"
- "40% retention"

**With context (strong):**
- "500 users (40% weekly retention)"
- "$5K MRR from 100 paying customers ($50 ARPU)"
- "40% weekly retention (industry avg: 25%)"

## Metric Framing Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Product

**Bad:**
"10,000 signups! Growing 500% month-over-month! Projected $1M ARR!"

**Good:**
"500 active users from 2,000 signups (25% activation). $2K MRR from 40 paying customers. 30% monthly retention."

**Why better:**
- Shows real activation vs. vanity signups
- Revenue tied to customer count
- Retention indicates product quality
- No hype language

### Example 2: Education Platform

**Bad:**
"Thousands of students love our platform! Featured in TechCrunch!"

**Good:**
"Helped 500 students achieve Band 6 in HSC English. 40% weekly active retention. 2,000+ essays marked with avg 4.5/5 satisfaction."

**Why better:**
- Specific outcome for specific users
- Retention shows ongoing value
- Work completed demonstrates scale
- User satisfaction validates quality

### Example 3: Early-Stage Product

**Bad:**
"Just launched but already seeing amazing traction!"

**Good:**
"50 users in first 3 months. Testing retention before scaling acquisition. Early feedback focuses on X issue; iterating on Y solution."

**Why better:**
- Honest about scale
- Shows decision-making maturity
- Focuses on learning, not bragging
- Appropriate for stage

---

## Absence of Metrics

**It's okay to have no metrics section if:**
- Product is too early
- Metrics don't add signal
- Outcomes are better described qualitatively

**What to emphasize instead:**
- Systems built
- Problems solved
- Decisions made
- Learnings gained

**Example (no metrics):**
"Built full-stack platform with Stripe integration, user auth, and essay analysis pipeline. Tested with 30 students to validate feedback accuracy. Learned that feedback speed matters more than comprehensiveness for retention—insight that now shapes how I approach all real-time feedback systems."

## Review Checklist

Before including metrics, verify:

- [ ] **Clarifies scope, doesn't inflate**
  - Helps employer understand scale and impact
  - Not designed to impress

- [ ] **No vanity metrics**
  - All metrics represent real usage or outcomes
  - Removed signups without activation, page views without conversion

- [ ] **No hype language**
  - No exclamation points
  - No "explosive", "viral", "crushing it"
  - Matter-of-fact tone

- [ ] **Context provided**
  - Raw numbers have context (retention %, customer count, timeframe)
  - Industry benchmarks if relevant
  - Appropriate for stage

- [ ] **Honest about stage**
  - Early products don't claim mature metrics
  - Ranges used when appropriate
  - Omitted if not meaningful

---

## Trust Test

For each metric included, ask:

1. **Does this clarify or inflate?**
   - If inflate: revise or remove

2. **Would I feel comfortable explaining this in an interview?**
   - If no: remove or add context

3. **Is this metric meaningful or vanity?**
   - If vanity: remove

4. **Is the tone matter-of-fact?**
   - If hype-y: revise language
