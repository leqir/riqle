# Startup Inclusion Standards

**Epic 6 - Story 6.2**

## Purpose
Define clear inclusion standards for what qualifies as a "startup" to ensure credibility is not diluted by aspirational or incomplete ventures.

---

## Included Categories

### ✅ Ventures where you had:
- **Founder or co-founder responsibility**
  - Strategic ownership of product direction
  - Decision-making authority on core systems
  - Accountability for outcomes

- **Strategic ownership**
  - Defined the problem and solution approach
  - Made architectural and technical decisions
  - Determined what to build and when

  - Built the systems yourself or led the team
  - Operated the business day-to-day
  - Delivered to real users

### ✅ Products with:
- **Real users**
  - Actual people using the product
  - Not just signups or waitlists
  - Active engagement or usage patterns

- **Real constraints**
  - Technical limitations to work within
  - Time and resource constraints
  - Market or user constraints that shaped decisions

- **Real consequences**
  - Decisions that affected users or revenue
  - Technical debt or architectural choices with long-term impact
  - Failures that taught concrete lessons

---

## Excluded Categories

### ❌ Idea decks
- Pitch presentations without implementation
- Concepts that never reached users
- Strategic plans without execution

### ❌ Hackathon demos (unless evolved into real products)
- Weekend projects that stayed prototypes
- Demos built for competition, not users
- One-off experiments without iteration

### ❌ Experiments without users
- Side projects built for learning only
- Internal tools with no external users
- Prototypes never released

### ❌ Landing pages without systems behind them
- Marketing sites without products
- Waitlist pages for ideas not built
- "Coming soon" pages for concepts

## Inclusion Checklist

For each potential startup, ask:

- [ ] **Did you have founder or strategic ownership?**
  - Can you explain the key strategic decisions you made?
  - Did the product direction depend on your decisions?

- [ ] **Were you accountable for execution?**
  - Did you build the core systems or lead the team?
  - Would the product have failed without your work?

- [ ] **Did it have real users facing real constraints?**
  - Can you name specific users or user segments?
  - What constraints did they face that your product addressed?

- [ ] **Would failure have had real consequences?**
  - Were users depending on the product?
  - Was revenue or reputation at stake?
  - Did decisions have lasting impact?

- [ ] **Can you discuss operational details confidently?**
  - Technical architecture decisions
  - User acquisition and retention strategies
  - What worked and what didn't
  - Specific metrics and outcomes

---

## Quality Bar

### Must demonstrate:
1. **End-to-end ownership**
   - From problem definition to user delivery
   - Not just one piece of the puzzle
   - Clear articulation of your role and responsibility

2. **Concrete users or learnings**
   - Actual people using the product, or
   - Specific, articulable lessons from building and operating
   - Not theoretical or aspirational

3. **Decisions with consequences**
   - Technical choices that shaped the product
   - Strategic decisions that affected outcomes
   - Tradeoffs you can defend and explain

---

## Examples

### ✅ Included: MarkPoint
- **Ownership:** Solo founder with full strategic and execution responsibility
- **Users:** 500+ HSC English students actively using the platform
- **Constraints:** Technical (AI feedback accuracy), operational (support load), economic (pricing vs. student budgets)
- **Consequences:** Students depend on feedback for exam prep; revenue sustains operations
- **Details:** Can discuss technical architecture, pedagogical approach, retention challenges, iteration decisions

### ❌ Excluded: Weekend Project Without Users
- Built a task management app over a weekend
- No users beyond yourself
- No iteration or operational experience
- No real constraints or consequences

### ❌ Excluded: Idea Deck
- Created pitch deck for marketplace concept
- Never built the product
- No users, no code, no operations
- Only strategic thinking, no execution

## Review Process

### Annual Review
Once per year, review all published startups:

1. **Still representative?**
   - Does this startup represent capabilities I want to demonstrate today?
   - Would I discuss this confidently in an interview?

2. **Meets quality bar?**
   - Does it still demonstrate ownership, users, and consequences?
   - Has the quality bar evolved beyond what this represents?

3. **Adds signal?**
   - Does this increase or decrease credibility?
   - Does it strengthen or dilute the narrative?

### Content Updates
For included startups:
- Update outcomes/status as situations change
- Refresh learnings with new perspective
- Archive if no longer representative (set `published: false`)

---

## Governance

- **Maximum visible startups:** 1-3
- **Primary venture always featured:** MarkPoint
- **Archive, don't delete:** Keep in database for history
- **Signal density over quantity:** 1 strong startup > 3 weak ones
