# Diagram Guidelines

**Epic 7 - Story 7.7**

## Purpose
Ensure diagrams reduce cognitive load rather than perform. Use sparingly, only when words alone are insufficient.

---

## Core Principle

**A diagram should make something easier to understand, not make you look smart.**

Use diagrams only when:
- The concept is inherently spatial or relational
- A visual representation reduces cognitive load
- Words alone would require significant mental model building

Don't use diagrams to:
- Make the essay look more professional
- Break up text
- Show off design skills
- Make simple concepts seem complex

---

## Maximum: One Diagram Per Essay

**Rule:** Max 1 diagram per essay.

**Why:**
- Forces you to choose what's truly essential
- Prevents visual clutter
- Maintains library feel (not slide deck)
- Ensures text works standalone

**If you think you need more than one diagram:**
1. Can these be combined into a single diagram?
2. Is one diagram more essential than the other?
3. Can one be explained in text instead?
4. Should this be split into multiple essays?

---

## When to Use Diagrams

### ✅ Good Reasons

**1. System Architecture**
- When explaining how components interact
- When showing data flow or process flow
- When relationships are complex and spatial

**Example:** "MarkPoint's feedback pipeline: Student submission → AI analysis → Framework matching → Personalized feedback"

**2. Process Flows**
- When sequence matters and has branches
- When showing decision trees
- When multiple steps interact

**Example:** "How I evaluate product ideas: User need → Technical feasibility → Business viability → Decision"

**3. Conceptual Relationships**
- When showing hierarchies or dependencies
- When mapping abstract concepts
- When illustrating tradeoffs

**Example:** "The speed-depth-breadth triangle in essay feedback"

**4. Before/After Comparisons**
- When showing structural change
- When illustrating transformation
- When demonstrating improvement

**Example:** "Old content-first teaching vs. new framework-first teaching"

### ❌ Bad Reasons

**Don't use diagrams for:**
- Simple linear lists (use bullets instead)
- Concepts easily explained in 1-2 sentences
- Making the essay look more "professional"
- Breaking up long blocks of text (break up the text instead)
- Showing you can make diagrams

**Examples of unnecessary diagrams:**
- A flowchart showing "Idea → Build → Test → Learn" (just say it)
- A Venn diagram showing two overlapping circles with one word each
- An org chart with 3 boxes
- A timeline with 3 events

## Style Rules

### Hand-Drawn Aesthetic

**Preferred:**
- Excalidraw or similar hand-drawn tools
- Simple boxes, circles, arrows
- Clean but informal
- Black, white, and one accent color (indigo)

**Why:**
- Matches professional record tone (not sales deck)
- Focuses on content, not polish
- Feels like whiteboard explanation
- Faster to create, easier to update

### Visual Constraints

**Use:**
- Thin lines (1-2px)
- Minimal color (black + indigo accent)
- Simple shapes (boxes, circles, arrows)
- Clear labels (sans-serif, readable size)
- White or off-white background

**Avoid:**
- Gradients or shadows
- Multiple colors for decoration
- Complex shapes or icons
- Decorative fonts
- Textures or patterns
- 3D effects

### Label Discipline

**Labels should be:**
- Short (1-5 words)
- Specific (not generic)
- Readable (sufficient size)
- Minimal (only what's necessary)

**Good labels:**
- "Student submission"
- "AI analysis engine"
- "Framework matching"
- "Personalized feedback"

**Bad labels:**
- "Input" (too generic)
- "Super advanced machine learning-powered artificial intelligence system for automated essay evaluation and feedback generation" (too long)
- "🎯 Magic happens here!" (decorative, not informative)

---

## Diagram Types

### ✅ Allowed Types

**1. System Diagrams**
- Components and connections
- Data flow
- Architecture overview

**When to use:** Explaining how a system works

**Example context:** "MarkPoint's feedback engine has three stages..."

**2. Process Flows**
- Sequential steps
- Decision points
- Branching paths

**When to use:** Explaining a workflow or decision process

**Example context:** "How I evaluate whether to build a feature..."

**3. Relationship Maps**
- Hierarchies
- Dependencies
- Conceptual connections

**When to use:** Showing how concepts relate

**Example context:** "The relationship between teaching methods, student outcomes, and retention..."

**4. Comparison Diagrams**
- Before/after
- Old vs. new
- Approach A vs. Approach B

**When to use:** Illustrating change or contrast

**Example context:** "Old: Content-first teaching. New: Framework-first teaching."

**5. Conceptual Models**
- Abstract frameworks
- Mental models
- Tradeoff triangles

**When to use:** Explaining how you think about a problem

**Example context:** "The speed-depth-breadth triangle: you can optimize for two..."

### ❌ Forbidden Types

**1. Stock Photos or Generic Icons**
- No people looking at laptops
- No lightbulb "ideas"
- No puzzle pieces "coming together"
- No handshake "partnerships"

**Why:** Performative, not explanatory

**2. Data Visualizations**
- No bar charts of vanity metrics
- No growth curves projecting upward
- No pie charts without specific data

**Why:** Should be in text with context, not standalone visuals

**Exception:** If you have real data that's essential to understanding, present it as simple table in text

**3. Mockups or Screenshots**
- No polished product mockups
- No marketing screenshots
- No staged interface examples

**Why:** This is writing, not a portfolio. If you need to show a UI, reference your Work section instead.

**4. Infographics**
- No "10 steps to..." posters
- No text-heavy visual layouts
- No decorative data presentations

**Why:** If it needs that much text, write it as text

**5. Animations or GIFs**
- No animated diagrams
- No loading states or transitions
- No video embeds

**Why:** Static library, not interactive media

## The No-Diagram Test

Before adding a diagram, ask:

### 1. Would the essay work without it?
- [ ] **If yes:** Consider cutting the diagram
- [ ] **If no:** Diagram might be necessary

### 2. Does it reduce cognitive load?
- [ ] **If yes:** Good candidate for diagram
- [ ] **If no:** Explain in text instead

### 3. Can I explain this in 2-3 sentences?
- [ ] **If yes:** Use text, not diagram
- [ ] **If no:** Diagram might help

### 4. Is this inherently spatial or relational?
- [ ] **If yes:** Diagram appropriate
- [ ] **If no:** Text is clearer

### 5. Am I adding this to look professional?
- [ ] **If yes:** Delete it
- [ ] **If no:** Proceed with caution

**Rule:** When in doubt, leave it out. Text-only essays are fine.

## Creating Diagrams

### Tools

**Preferred:**
- **Excalidraw** - Hand-drawn style, perfect for this purpose
- **Figma** - If you need precise alignment, use minimal styling
- **Pen and paper → scan** - If hand-drawn fits your style

**Avoid:**
- PowerPoint or Keynote (too formal)
- Canva (too decorative)
- Illustrator (too polished)

### Color Palette

**Use only:**
- **Black** (#000000 or #1C1917 stone-900) - Primary elements
- **Gray** (#78716C stone-500) - Secondary elements, labels
- **Indigo** (#4F46E5 indigo-600) - Accent, emphasis, highlights
- **White/Off-white** - Background

**Never use:**
- Multiple accent colors
- Bright or saturated colors for decoration
- Color gradients

### Size and Format

**Specifications:**
- Max width: 800px
- Format: PNG or SVG
- Aspect ratio: 16:9, 4:3, or square
- File size: Under 200KB

**Why these limits:**
- Loads fast
- Readable on mobile
- Doesn't dominate the page

### Placement

**In the essay:**
- After the text that introduces it
- Never before the context
- Surrounded by white space

**Not at:**
- Top of essay (start with text)
- Bottom as decoration
- Between unrelated paragraphs

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Good System Diagram

**Context:** Essay about MarkPoint's feedback engine

**Diagram shows:**
```
[Student Essay]
       ↓
[AI Analysis Engine]
       ↓
[Framework Matcher]
       ↓
[Personalized Feedback]
```

**Why good:**
- Shows sequential flow
- Labels are specific
- Hand-drawn style
- Simple arrows
- One accent color for active components

**Why necessary:**
- System has 4 distinct stages
- Flow is not obvious from text alone
- Understanding stages helps understand tradeoffs

### Example 2: Good Process Flow

**Context:** Essay about evaluating product ideas

**Diagram shows:**
```
                [Product Idea]
                      ↓
        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
        ↓                           ↓
[User Need Exists?]          [Technical Feasible?]
        ↓                           ↓
       Yes ──────────┬──────────── Yes
                     ↓
            [Worth Building?]
                  ↓              ↓
               Yes              No → Archive
                  ↓
               Build
```

**Why good:**
- Shows decision branches
- Reveals evaluation logic
- Hand-drawn boxes
- Clear decision points

**Why necessary:**
- Process has conditional branches
- Text description would be confusing
- Seeing flow clarifies the framework

### Example 3: Good Conceptual Model

**Context:** Essay about feedback tradeoffs

**Diagram shows:**
```
        Speed
        /   \
       /     \
    Depth - Breadth

Pick two. I chose Speed + Depth.
```

**Why good:**
- Illustrates tradeoff triangle
- Shows impossibility of all three
- Labels decision clearly
- Minimal, no decoration

**Why necessary:**
- Tradeoff is inherently spatial
- Triangle visualization makes it intuitive
- Text alone would require mental model building

### Example 4: Unnecessary Diagram

**Context:** Essay about why I built MarkPoint

**Bad diagram:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Problem   │
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Solution  │
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Impact    │
└─────────────┘
```

**Why bad:**
- Simple linear sequence
- No branches or complexity
- Easily explained: "I saw a problem, built a solution, and measured impact"
- Diagram adds nothing

**Fix:** Delete diagram. Use text:
"Students needed fast feedback. I built MarkPoint to deliver it in 24 hours instead of a week. Retention jumped from 15% to 40%."

### Example 5: Forbidden Diagram

**Bad:** Stock photo of person writing at desk with coffee

**Why forbidden:**
- Decorative, not explanatory
- Generic stock imagery
- Doesn't reduce cognitive load
- Performative

**Fix:** Delete it. Never use stock photos in writing.

## Maintenance

### Annual Review

Once per year, review all diagrams:

**Questions:**
1. Is this diagram still necessary?
2. Does it still accurately represent the system/process?
3. Is the style consistent with current guidelines?
4. Could it be simpler?

**Actions:**
- Update if system changed
- Simplify if possible
- Delete if no longer necessary
- Ensure consistent style across all diagrams

### Updating Diagrams

**When to update:**
- System or process changed
- You found a clearer way to show it
- Style doesn't match current guidelines

**When not to update:**
- Just to refresh the look
- To add more detail
- Because tools improved

**Remember:** Diagrams serve understanding, not aesthetics.
