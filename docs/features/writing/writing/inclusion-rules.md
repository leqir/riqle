# Writing Inclusion Standards

**Epic 7 - Story 7.2**

## Purpose
Define clear inclusion standards for what qualifies as "writing" to ensure signal is not diluted by generic content or performative pieces.

---

## Core Principle

**If a piece does not reveal how you reason, it does not belong.**

Writing should demonstrate:
- Independent thinking
- Clear reasoning
- Grounded experience
- Judgment, not just opinion

---

## Included Categories

### ✅ Essays on Core Themes

**Acceptable themes:**
- **Education** - Teaching, learning, pedagogy, frameworks
- **Systems** - How things work, architecture, design decisions
- **Learning** - Skill acquisition, knowledge transfer, mental models
- **Product** - Building, iteration, user understanding
- **Decision-making** - Tradeoffs, judgment, constraints

**Quality bar:**
- Demonstrates how you think, not just what you think
- Grounded in real experience (teaching, building, operating)
- Reveals decision-making process
- Shows independent judgment

### ✅ Post-Mortems

**What qualifies:**
- Thoughtful reflections after building something
- Honest assessment of what worked/didn't
- Specific lessons with broader application
- Not defensive, not performative

**Examples:**
- "What I learned building MarkPoint's feedback engine"
- "Post-mortem: Why our onboarding flow failed"
- "Three months of teaching HSC English: What actually worked"

### ✅ Framework Explanations

**What qualifies:**
- Frameworks you actually use in your work
- Not theoretical or aspirational
- Concrete examples of application
- Helps others understand your thinking process

**Examples:**

**Not included:**

- Repackaged advice from others

## Publishing Frequency

### Event-Driven, Not Scheduled

**Publish when:**
- You've thought deeply about a real question
- You have a framework or insight to share
- You've learned something worth documenting
- A post-mortem has clarity and lessons

**Don't publish:**
- To maintain cadence
- Because it's been a while
- To "stay active"
- Before the thinking is clear

**Quality over consistency.**

Better to publish 4 essays/year that demonstrate clear thinking than 52 generic posts.

---

## Review Process

### Before Publishing

Run each essay through this checklist:

- [ ] **Inclusion test:** Meets all 5 inclusion criteria?
- [ ] **Reasoning test:** Shows HOW I think, not just WHAT?
- [ ] **Experience test:** Grounded in something I've done?
- [ ] **Interview test:** Can I discuss this in depth?
- [ ] **Signal test:** Helps employers assess thinking quality?

**All must pass before publishing.**

### Annual Review

Once per year, review all published essays:

1. **Still representative?**
   - Does this still show how I think?
   - Have I evolved beyond this?

2. **Still adds signal?**
   - Increases trust or raises questions?
   - Strengthens or weakens narrative?

3. **Archive if:**
   - No longer representative
   - Weakens overall signal
   - Replaced by better essay on same topic

---

## Governance

### Maximum Published Essays

**No hard limit**, but curated for quality.

Guideline: 5-15 essays is often ideal
- Enough to show thinking breadth
- Few enough to maintain quality bar
- All add distinct signal

### Archive Rather Than Delete

Like startups, essays should be archived (unpublished), not deleted.

**Why:**
- Historical record
- May become relevant again
- Learning archive

---

## Summary

**Include if:**
- Reveals how you reason
- Grounded in real experience
- Demonstrates independent judgment
- Can discuss in depth
- Adds signal about thinking quality

**Exclude if:**
- Generic or could be written by anyone
- Performative or trend-driven
- SEO-optimized
- Published to "stay active"
- Doesn't demonstrate judgment

**Remember:**
The goal is not to build an audience—it's to make your thinking inspectable so employers can assess judgment without an interview.
