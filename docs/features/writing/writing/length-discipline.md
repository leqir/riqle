# Length Discipline Guidelines

**Epic 7 - Story 7.6**

## Purpose
Maintain clarity and respect reader time by cutting essays to essential length. Prefer short, prefer clear, never pad.

---

## Core Principle

**If it doesn't help the reader understand, cut it.**

Every sentence should either:
- Add new information
- Clarify a complex point
- Provide a necessary example
- Connect ideas logically

If it does none of these, delete it.

---

## Preferred Lengths

### Short Essays (500-800 words)
**Best for:**
- Single clear insight
- Post-mortems of specific decisions
- Framework explanations
- Tactical lessons

**Structure:**
- 1-2 paragraph intro (state insight)
- 2-3 body sections (context, what happened, why it matters)
- 1 paragraph conclusion (restate lesson, caveat scope)

**Example topics:**
- "Why I prioritized speed over comprehensiveness in feedback"
- "Teaching frameworks instead of content: What worked"
- "How I evaluate product ideas before building"

### Medium Essays (1000-1500 words)
**Best for:**
- Multiple related insights
- System explanations with context
- Decisions with nuanced tradeoffs
- Cross-domain lessons

**Structure:**
- 2-3 paragraph intro (context + core insight)
- 3-5 body sections with headings
- 1-2 paragraph conclusion

**Example topics:**
- "Building MarkPoint's feedback engine: Speed vs. depth tradeoff"
- "Post-mortem: What I learned from 500 students"
- "How I structure feedback for different learning contexts"

### Long Essays (2000+ words)
**Use sparingly.** Only when:
- Multiple interconnected insights that can't be separated
- Complex system requiring full explanation
- Deep exploration of nuanced tradeoffs

**Structure requirements:**
- Strong intro that front-loads value (reader knows what they'll get)
- Clear section headings outlining the argument
- Subheadings within sections if needed
- Multiple concrete examples throughout
- Summary section before conclusion

**Warning:** If essay exceeds 2000 words, consider splitting into multiple essays.

## The Cutting Process

### First Pass: Structural Cut

Ask these questions:

**1. Can this be shorter?**
- Is the intro necessary or can I start with the insight?
- Are there sections that repeat the same point?
- Can I combine sections that cover related ideas?

**2. Does every section earn its place?**
- Would the essay work without this section?
- Does this section add new information or just restate?
- Is this background actually necessary for understanding?

**3. Is this as clear as possible?**
- Am I using 3 sentences where 1 would work?
- Are there unnecessary qualifiers or hedges?
- Can I replace a paragraph with a single example?

### Second Pass: Sentence-Level Cut

**Cut:**
- First paragraph (often unnecessary warm-up)
- Transitional throat-clearing ("It's important to note that...")
- Repeated points in different words
- Unnecessary context or background
- Defensive hedging ("I think that maybe...")
- Rhetorical questions
- Filler conclusions that just restate the intro

**Keep:**
- Specific examples with details
- Clear statements of insight
- Necessary context that explains decisions
- Honest caveats about scope or uncertainty
- Concrete data or metrics

### Third Pass: Word-Level Cut

**Replace wordy phrases with simple words:**
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "Make a decision" → "Decide"
- "Facilitate" → "Help"
- "Utilize" → "Use"

**Remove unnecessary modifiers:**
- "Very unique" → "Unique"
- "Quite interesting" → "Interesting" (or delete)
- "Really important" → "Important"
- "Somewhat concerned" → "Concerned"

---

## Structure for Long Essays

When an essay must be long (2000+ words), structure becomes critical.

### Required Elements

**1. Front-Loaded Value**

Start with the core insight immediately. Readers should know within 2 paragraphs:
- What they'll learn
- Why it matters
- What experience grounds this

**Good example:**
"After teaching 500 HSC English students, I learned that frameworks beat content every time. This insight changed how I teach—and how I built MarkPoint's feedback engine. Here's what worked, what didn't, and why this matters beyond education."

**Bad example:**
"Education is evolving. Technology is changing how we learn. In today's landscape, we face new challenges. I've been thinking about this for a while..."

### 2. Clear Section Headings

Headings should outline the argument so a reader can scan and understand the structure.

**Good headings:**
- "The Problem with Content-First Teaching"
- "What Worked: Teaching Frameworks Instead"
- "Why This Approach Failed for Advanced Students"
- "Lessons for Product Development"

**Bad headings:**
- "Part 1: Background"
- "Some Thoughts"
- "Reflections"
- "The Journey"

### 3. Subheadings Within Sections

If a section exceeds 400 words, use subheadings to break it up.

**Example:**
```
## Building MarkPoint's Feedback Engine

### Speed vs. Comprehensiveness: The Core Tradeoff
[Content about the decision...]

### What Students Actually Wanted
[Content about user research...]

### Implementation and Results
[Content about building and testing...]
```

### 4. Multiple Concrete Examples

Long essays need multiple examples to maintain reader engagement and demonstrate depth.

**Rule:** At least one concrete example per major section.

### 5. Summary Before Conclusion

For essays over 1500 words, add a summary section before the conclusion:

**Summary structure:**
- 3-5 bullet points
- Each captures one key insight
- No new information, just distillation

## Red Flags

These indicate the essay needs cutting:

### 🚩 Long Introduction (>150 words)

**Problem:** You're warming up, not adding value.

**Fix:** Delete everything before the core insight. Start there instead.

### 🚩 Repetitive Points

**Problem:** You've made the same point 3 times in different words.

**Fix:** Choose the clearest version. Delete the others.

### 🚩 Vague Examples

**Problem:** "For instance, I noticed students struggled with analysis."

**Fix:** "After grading 200 essays, 80% made the same mistake: they summarized quotes instead of analyzing them."

**Better yet:** If you can't make the example concrete, delete it.

### 🚩 Rambling Conclusion

**Problem:** Conclusion restates the intro, adds grand statements, or hedges unnecessarily.

**Fix:** State the lesson, caveat the scope, done.

**Good conclusion:**
"Frameworks beat content, but only when students have time to internalize them. This worked for 16-18 year olds learning essay writing. I'm not sure it applies to other subjects or age groups."

**Bad conclusion:**
"In conclusion, as we've seen throughout this essay, education is changing, and by leveraging frameworks instead of content, we can potentially transform how students learn. The future is exciting, and I'm optimistic about what's possible..."

### 🚩 Hedging Every Sentence

**Problem:** "I think that maybe this might possibly work in some contexts sometimes."

**Fix:** Be honest about uncertainty, but don't hedge everything.

**Better:** "This worked for my students. I'm not sure if it generalizes."

- [ ] **Is the structure visible?**
  - Headings outline the argument
  - Reader can scan and understand

### Content Check
- [ ] **Is every example concrete?**
  - Names, numbers, specific details
  - If vague, cut or improve

- [ ] **Have I removed repetition?**
  - Same point made only once
  - No circling back unnecessarily

- [ ] **Is every sentence necessary?**
  - Adds information, clarifies, or connects
  - If not, delete

### Sentence Check
- [ ] **Have I removed filler phrases?**
  - "It's important to note that..."
  - "At the end of the day..."
  - "The thing is..."

- [ ] **Are sentences as short as possible?**
  - One idea per sentence
  - No unnecessary clauses

## Examples

### Example 1: Cutting an Introduction

**Before (180 words):**
"In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, we face unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Technology has transformed how students learn, how teachers teach, and how we think about education itself. Over the past several years, I've been deeply involved in education, both as a teacher and as a founder building educational technology. Through this experience, I've learned many lessons, but one stands out above all others: the importance of teaching frameworks rather than content. This realization didn't come all at once—it emerged gradually through hundreds of interactions with students, countless hours of grading essays, and deep reflection on what actually helps students improve. In this essay, I want to share this insight with you, explain how I arrived at it, and explore what it might mean for education more broadly. I believe this lesson has implications not just for teaching, but for product development, skill acquisition, and knowledge transfer in many contexts."

**After (40 words):**
"After teaching 500 HSC English students, I learned that frameworks beat content. Students who learned 'how to evaluate a quote' outperformed those who memorized 'what this quote means.' Here's what worked and why."

**What was cut:**
- Generic context ("today's landscape")
- Personal narrative about arriving at the insight
- Setup about what the essay will cover
- Grand claims about implications

**What remained:**
- Concrete experience (500 students)
- Core insight (frameworks > content)
- Specific example (evaluate vs. memorize)
- Promise of what's coming (what worked and why)

### Example 2: Cutting Repetition

**Before (3 paragraphs, 240 words):**
"Speed matters in feedback. When students receive feedback quickly, they can act on it while the work is still fresh in their minds. This immediacy is crucial for learning.

I noticed that students who got feedback within 24 hours improved faster than those who waited a week. The quick turnaround meant they could revise while they still remembered their thinking process. This made the feedback more actionable.

The lesson is clear: feedback speed is more important than feedback comprehensiveness. Students benefit more from fast, focused feedback than from slow, exhaustive analysis. This is because the context is still available to them when feedback arrives quickly."

**After (1 paragraph, 80 words):**
"Students who received feedback within 24 hours improved faster than those who waited a week. Quick turnaround meant they could act while context was fresh—they still remembered their thinking, their decisions, their struggles. I learned that feedback speed matters more than comprehensiveness. Better to give fast, focused feedback on 2-3 key issues than slow, exhaustive analysis of everything."

**What was cut:**
- First paragraph (generic statement of the point)
- Third paragraph (restatement of the same point)
- Repetitive phrases ("this is crucial", "the lesson is clear")

**What remained:**
- Concrete comparison (24 hours vs. a week)
- Specific benefit (context was fresh)
- Clear lesson (speed > comprehensiveness)
- Actionable insight (focus on 2-3 issues)

### Example 3: Cutting a Rambling Conclusion

**Before (150 words):**
"In conclusion, as we've explored throughout this essay, teaching frameworks rather than content represents a fundamental shift in how we approach education. This insight has implications not just for classroom teaching, but potentially for product development, skill acquisition, and knowledge transfer in many different contexts. While I'm optimistic about the possibilities, I recognize that this approach may not work for everyone in every situation. More research is needed to validate these findings across different age groups, subjects, and learning contexts. Nevertheless, I believe this is an important direction for education to explore. As we move forward into an uncertain future, frameworks that teach students how to think will be more valuable than content that tells them what to think. I'm excited to continue exploring these ideas and seeing where they lead."

**After (35 words):**
"Frameworks beat content for my 500 HSC English students. I'm not sure this applies to other subjects or age groups, but the principle might transfer: teach how to think, not what to think."

**What was cut:**
- "In conclusion" and essay recap
- Grand claims about implications
- Hedging about research needed
- Vague statements about the future
- Performance language ("I'm excited")

**What remained:**
- Specific scope (500 HSC English students)
- Honest uncertainty (not sure about other contexts)
- Core principle clearly stated
- Caveat about generalization

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Padding to Reach Target Length

**Problem:** "This essay is only 600 words but I think it should be longer."

**Fix:** If you've said everything that needs saying, you're done. Don't add filler.

**Remember:** A complete 600-word essay beats an artificially padded 1200-word essay every time.

### Mistake 2: Cutting Too Much Context

**Problem:** "I'll cut all the background to make it shorter."

**Fix:** Keep the context necessary for understanding your decisions. Cut everything else.

**Test:** Would a smart reader unfamiliar with your project understand your reasoning? If no, add context.

### Mistake 3: Deleting All Caveats

**Problem:** "Caveats make the essay longer, so I'll remove them."

**Fix:** Keep honest caveats about scope and uncertainty. Delete defensive hedging.

**Keep:** "This worked for my students. I'm not sure it generalizes."
**Delete:** "I think that maybe this might work but I could be wrong and there are probably exceptions..."

### Mistake 4: Sacrificing Clarity for Brevity

**Problem:** Dense, compressed writing that's hard to parse.

**Fix:** Clear beats brief. If cutting makes it unclear, keep it longer.

**Example:**
- Too brief: "Frameworks work. Content doesn't."
- Clear: "Students who learned frameworks (how to evaluate quotes) improved more than those who memorized content (what quotes mean)."

---

## Summary

**Length discipline means:**
- Cut everything that doesn't help understanding
- Prefer short (500-800 words) when possible
- Go longer only when necessary
- Structure long essays carefully
- Delete first paragraphs and rambling conclusions
- Remove repetition ruthlessly
- Keep concrete examples and necessary context

**Remember:**
Respect the reader's time. Every word should earn its place.
