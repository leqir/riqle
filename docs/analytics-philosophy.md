# Analytics Philosophy: Anti-Dashboard Stance

## Core Principles

**Analytics should feel like an instrument panel, not a casino.**

### 1. Fewer Metrics > More Metrics

**Rule:** Only track metrics that answer core questions

**Implementation:**
- Maximum 15 tracked events
- Every metric must justify its existence
- Remove metrics that are never reviewed

### 2. Directional Truth > Precision

**Rule:** Approximate trends beat precise numbers

**Examples:**
- "Bounce rate is decreasing" > "Bounce rate is 64.3%"
- "Engagement is stable" > "Average time is 2:37"
- "Commerce is healthy" > "Conversion is 3.2%"

### 3. Trends Over Snapshots

**Rule:** Compare periods, not days

**Implementation:**
- Week-over-week comparison
- Month-over-month trends
- Ignore daily fluctuations

### 4. Insight Over Numbers

**Rule:** Translate metrics into meaning

**Examples:**

Not: "1,245 visitors"
Instead: "Traffic stable, employers finding site"

Not: "4.2% conversion"
Instead: "Commerce healthy, low refunds"

## Explicitly Banned Patterns

### Vanity Metrics (raw pageviews without context)
- **Reason:** Creates anxiety, not insight
- **Alternative:** Track engagement quality instead

### Real-Time Dashboards
- **Reason:** Encourages compulsive checking
- **Alternative:** Weekly summaries only

### Gamified Charts (leaderboards, progress bars)
- **Reason:** Optimizes for metrics, not mission
- **Alternative:** Simple tables and trends

### Heatmaps (click maps, scroll maps)
- **Reason:** Privacy-invasive, rarely actionable
- **Alternative:** Direct user feedback

### Session Replays
- **Reason:** Creepy, unnecessary
- **Alternative:** Aggregate behavior patterns only

### Funnel Optimization Frameworks
- **Reason:** Leads to dark patterns
- **Alternative:** Trust-first commerce validation
