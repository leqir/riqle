# Publishing Governance

**Epic 7 - Story 7.9**

## Purpose
Maintain publishing discipline to ensure quality over consistency. Event-driven publishing, not scheduled content.

---

## Core Principle

**Publish when you have something worth saying, not because it's time to post.**

Quality essays published infrequently beat regular mediocre posts every time.

**Remember:** This is a professional record, not a content engine. The goal is demonstrating judgment quality, not building an audience.

---

## Event-Driven Publishing

### What This Means

**Publish when:**
- You've learned something worth documenting
- You've built something with clear lessons
- You have a framework you actually use and can explain
- A post-mortem has clarity and actionable insights
- You've thought deeply about a real question

**Don't publish when:**
- It's been a while since your last post
- You want to "stay active"
- You feel you should be publishing
- The thinking isn't clear yet
- You're trying to build momentum

### Why Event-Driven Works

**For you:**
- Freedom to think deeply without deadline pressure
- Permission to sit on ideas until they're clear
- No obligation to produce on schedule
- Better final quality

**For readers:**
- Higher signal-to-noise ratio
- Every essay is worth their time
- No filler content to skip
- Trust that published work is meaningful

**For hiring decisions:**
- Demonstrates discipline and judgment
- Shows you prioritize quality over visibility
- Proves you can ship complete thoughts
- Signals long-term thinking

## Publishing Frequency

### No Minimum Cadence

**There is no minimum publishing frequency.**

Acceptable gaps:
- **3-6 months:** Common and fine
- **6-12 months:** Acceptable if quality is high
- **12+ months:** Rare but okay if circumstances warrant

**What matters:**
- Essays are high quality when they do appear
- Each essay demonstrates clear thinking
- Collection shows depth and judgment
- No filler to maintain cadence

### No Maximum Cadence

**There is no maximum publishing frequency.**

But beware:
- Publishing weekly often means quality suffers
- Rapid publishing can signal content creation vs. deep thinking
- Better to have 3 strong essays/year than 52 okay ones

**Heuristic:** If you're publishing more than once per month, check:
1. Is each essay meeting the quality bar?
2. Am I writing to stay visible vs. sharing genuine insights?
3. Would I defend every essay in an interview?

---

## When to Publish

### ✅ Publish When:

**1. Thinking is Clear**
- You can state the core insight in one sentence
- You have concrete examples from your experience
- The essay passes all inclusion and style tests
- You'd confidently discuss this in an interview

**2. Adds Distinct Signal**
- This essay shows how you think in a new way
- It's not redundant with existing essays
- It demonstrates judgment or capability
- Employers would understand you better after reading

**3. Grounded in Real Work**
- Based on teaching, building, or operating experience
- Not theoretical or aspirational
- Concrete learnings and specific examples
- Honest about what worked and what didn't

**4. Passes Validation**
- External validation complete (3-5 test readers)
- Emotional outcome is right (respect, trust, confidence)
- No performance language or buzzwords
- Interview simulation passed

**5. Timing is Right**
- You've had time to reflect and gain perspective
- Not reactive to trends or news
- Insights are durable, not time-sensitive
- Will be relevant in 6-12 months

### ❌ Don't Publish When:

**1. Maintaining Cadence**
- "It's been 3 months, I should post something"
- "I want to stay active"
- "Everyone else is publishing regularly"

**Fix:** Wait until you have something worth saying.

**2. Incomplete Thinking**
- You're still figuring out the insight
- Examples are vague or hypothetical
- You're not sure you'd defend this in an interview

**Fix:** Sit on it. Revisit in 2-4 weeks.

**3. Reactive to Trends**
- Responding to news or hot topics
- Joining a discourse that's already happening
- "Everyone is talking about X, so..."

**Fix:** If the insight is durable, wait 3 months and see if it still matters. If not, skip it.

**4. Trying to Impress**
- Writing to show you're smart
- Using jargon or complexity unnecessarily
- Optimizing for shares or engagement

**Fix:** Reframe for clarity and honesty. If it doesn't survive, don't publish.

**5. Before Validation**
- Haven't run it by test readers
- Haven't done interview simulation
- Haven't checked emotional outcome

**Fix:** Complete validation process first.

## Acceptable Gaps Between Essays

### 3-6 Months: Ideal
This is a healthy cadence for thoughtful, grounded writing.

**Why this works:**
- Enough time to learn and reflect
- Multiple experiences to draw from
- Perspective on what matters
- No pressure to produce on schedule

### 6-12 Months: Acceptable
Longer gaps are fine if you're building, learning, or reflecting.

**Common reasons:**
- Deep work on a project (MarkPoint, Riqle)
- Learning phase without clear insights yet
- Teaching full-time with less time to write
- Waiting for perspective on recent experience

**Not a problem if:**
- Essays that do appear are high quality
- You're actively building or learning
- Gaps are acknowledged honestly (if relevant)

### 12+ Months: Rare but Okay
Very long gaps should be rare but aren't disqualifying.

**Acceptable if:**
- You were deeply focused on building something meaningful
- You're waiting for perspective on complex experience
- Life circumstances limited reflection time
- Quality remains high when you do publish

**Red flag if:**
- You published one essay then abandoned the section
- Long gap with no clear reason
- Suggests lack of sustained thinking

### Multiple Essays in Quick Succession: Caution
Publishing several essays within weeks can signal:
- Content creation mindset vs. deep thinking
- Backlog publishing (which is fine if quality is high)
- Trying to build momentum (misaligned with purpose)

**When this is okay:**
- Publishing a backlog of strong essays you've been sitting on
- Series of related essays on a coherent project
- Each essay still meets full quality bar

**When this is a red flag:**
- Quality drops to maintain frequency
- Essays feel rushed or incomplete
- You're trying to "get to 10 essays" quickly

---

## Special Cases

### Backlog Publishing

**Scenario:** You have 3-5 strong essays written but not published yet.

**Okay to:**
- Publish them over 2-3 months
- Release all at once if quality is uniformly high
- Stagger them weekly if each is distinct

**Not okay to:**
- Publish them all to hit a number ("I want 10 essays live")
- Rush publication without validation
- Lower the bar because "they're already written"

**Rule:** Treat backlog essays the same as new ones. Each must pass the full checklist.

### Series or Multi-Part Essays

**Scenario:** You have a complex topic that needs multiple essays.

**Preferred approach:**
- Make each essay standalone (can be read independently)
- Cross-link essays in the "Related" section
- Each essay has its own core insight

**Avoid:**
- "Part 1 of 3" series that requires reading all
- Cliffhangers or incomplete thoughts
- Publishing parts before the full series is written

**Why:** Each essay should provide value independently. Series should be discovered, not required.

### Time-Sensitive Topics

**Scenario:** You learned something from current events or trends.

**Wait 3 months.**

If the insight is still relevant and durable after 3 months, it's worth publishing. If not, it was a hot take.

**Exceptions:**
- None. If it's truly valuable, it will still matter in 3 months.

## Annual Review Process

Once per year, review your publishing patterns:

### Questions to Ask

**1. Quality over Time**
- [ ] Is the quality bar consistent or improving?
- [ ] Did any essays slip below the bar?
- [ ] Should any be archived?

**2. Frequency**
- [ ] Was I publishing to maintain cadence vs. share insights?
- [ ] Did gaps correlate with deep work or with avoiding writing?
- [ ] Is frequency aligned with event-driven philosophy?

**3. Signal Density**
- [ ] Does the collection demonstrate clear thinking?
- [ ] Are there redundant essays that weaken signal?
- [ ] Should any be consolidated or archived?

**4. Future Direction**
- [ ] What themes emerged from this year's writing?
- [ ] What areas need more depth or clarity?
- [ ] What should I focus on next?

### Actions

Based on review:
- **Archive** essays that no longer meet quality bar
- **Update** essays with changed understanding (mark as updated)
- **Consolidate** redundant essays if possible
- **Adjust** publishing approach if needed

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Publishing to Stay Visible

**Problem:** "I haven't posted in 4 months, I should write something."

**Why it's wrong:**
- Optimizing for consistency over quality
- Misaligned with professional record purpose
- Often results in lower-quality essays

**Fix:**
- Reaffirm: This is not a blog, it's a library
- Wait until you have something worth saying
- Trust that gaps are fine

### Mistake 2: Rushing Publication

**Problem:** "I just learned something, I'll write it up and publish this week."

**Why it's wrong:**
- Haven't had time to reflect
- Insight may not be durable
- Examples may not be concrete yet

**Fix:**
- Sit on it for 2-4 weeks
- See if the insight holds
- Let concrete examples emerge

### Mistake 3: Publishing Hot Takes

**Problem:** "Everyone's talking about [trend], I'll share my thoughts."

**Why it's wrong:**
- Reactive, not thoughtful
- Optimized for engagement, not clarity
- Unlikely to be durable

**Fix:**
- Wait 3 months
- If it still matters, write about it
- If not, skip it

### Mistake 4: Artificial Cadence

**Problem:** "I want to publish once per month."

**Why it's wrong:**
- Scheduled publishing creates pressure to produce
- Quality often suffers to hit dates
- Misaligned with event-driven philosophy

**Fix:**
- Remove the schedule
- Publish when ready, not when time
- Trust the process

### Mistake 5: Comparing to Others

**Problem:** "Other people publish way more often than me."

**Why it's wrong:**
- They may have different goals (audience building vs. professional record)
- Their quality bar may be different
- Comparison creates pressure to publish before ready

**Fix:**
- Remember your purpose: demonstrating judgment to employers
- Trust your quality bar
- Publish when you meet your standards, not theirs

## Guidelines by Essay Type

### Post-Mortems
**When to publish:**
- After project completion or significant milestone
- After enough time for honest reflection (usually 1-3 months)
- When lessons are clear and actionable

**Don't publish:**
- Immediately after project ends (too raw)
- While still defensive or emotional
- Before you have perspective

### Framework Explanations
**When to publish:**
- After using the framework consistently (6+ months)
- When you have multiple concrete examples
- When you can explain why it works and when it doesn't

**Don't publish:**
- Immediately after discovering a framework
- Frameworks you read about but don't actually use
- Before you have real examples

### System Explanations
**When to publish:**
- After system is built and operational
- When you understand tradeoffs clearly
- When you can discuss alternatives honestly

**Don't publish:**
- While system is still in development
- Before you've lived with the tradeoffs
- If you'd build it differently now (write about that instead)

### Cross-Domain Lessons
**When to publish:**
- After applying insight in new domain successfully
- When transfer is proven, not hypothetical
- When you can explain why it transferred

**Don't publish:**
- Immediately upon noticing similarity
- Before testing transfer hypothesis
- If transfer is speculative

---

## Summary

**Publishing governance:**
- Event-driven, not scheduled
- Publish when you have something worth saying
- Quality over consistency always
- Gaps of 3-6 months are normal and healthy
- Complete full checklist before publishing
- No minimum or maximum cadence
- Annual review to maintain quality

**Remember:**
This is a professional record, not a content engine. Every essay should demonstrate judgment. Gaps are fine. Quality is everything.
