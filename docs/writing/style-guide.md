# Writing Style Guide

**Epic 7 - Story 7.5**

## Purpose
Ensure essays feel careful rather than impressive, allowing readers to assess judgment without fighting through jargon or theatrics.

---

## Core Principle

**The writing should feel like you're explaining something to a capable colleague, not performing for an audience.**

Readers should be able to:
- Understand without re-reading
- Assess your judgment directly
- Feel confident you'd stand by every sentence in an interview

---

## Required Qualities

### 1. Plain Language

**Use everyday words, avoid jargon unless necessary.**

**Good examples:**
- "Students learn better with fast feedback"
- "I built a system to analyze essays automatically"
- "The retention rate dropped when we added too many features"

**Bad examples:**
- "We leveraged synergies to optimize learning outcomes"
- "Our paradigm-shifting approach disrupted traditional pedagogical frameworks"
- "Utilizing cutting-edge AI to revolutionize education"

**Rule:** If a simpler word exists, use it.

### 2. Concrete Examples

**Every abstract point needs a concrete example.**

**Good examples:**
- "Frameworks beat content. For instance, instead of teaching 'here's what this quote means,' I taught 'here's how to evaluate whether a quote is worth including.'"
- "Retention jumped from 15% to 40% after we prioritized speed over comprehensiveness."
- "After interviewing 50 students, the pattern emerged: they needed fast feedback on 1-2 core issues, not exhaustive analysis."

**Bad examples:**
- "Quality matters more than quantity" (vague, no example)
- "Users value speed" (abstract, no data)
- "Education needs to change" (grand statement, no specifics)

**Rule:** Every abstract claim gets a concrete example from your experience.

### 3. Clear Structure

**Headings outline the argument, paragraphs stay focused.**

**Good structure:**
- H1: Main title
- Intro paragraph: States the core insight
- H2: Problem or context
- H2: What worked / Solution
- H2: Why this matters beyond the specific case
- H2: What you'd do differently

**Paragraph guidelines:**
- 3-5 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- Logical flow from point to point

**Bad structure:**
- Long paragraphs (8+ sentences)
- Multiple ideas mixed together
- Unclear progression

**Rule:** If a paragraph has more than one main idea, split it.

### 4. Honest Uncertainty

**Admit what you don't know, caveat strong claims.**

**Good examples:**
- "I don't know if this applies to larger teams, but it worked at our scale."
- "This might not generalize beyond education, but here's why I think it might..."
- "I'm not certain this was the only factor, but the correlation was strong."

**Bad examples:**
- "This always works" (overconfident)
- "Everyone should do this" (too universal)
- Presenting correlation as causation without caveat

**Rule:** When uncertain, say so. It builds trust.

## Explicit Bans

### ❌ Buzzwords

**Words and phrases to avoid:**
- "Disruptive", "game-changing", "revolutionary"
- "Paradigm shift", "thought leader", "ninja/rockstar/guru"
- "Synergy", "leverage", "utilize" (use "use")
- "Cutting-edge", "bleeding-edge", "next-generation"
- "Holistic", "robust", "scalable" (without specific meaning)

**Why:** Buzzwords signal performance over substance.

### ❌ Over-Abstract Language

**Avoid vague business speak:**
- "Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes"
- "Deploy a holistic approach to student engagement"
- "Facilitate meaningful learning experiences at scale"

**Replace with specific language:**
- "I combined two features to improve results"
- "I looked at multiple factors affecting student engagement"
- "I helped 500 students learn effectively"

**Why:** Abstract language hides rather than reveals thinking.

### ❌ Rhetorical Questions as Filler

**Avoid:**
- "But what if we could do better?"
- "What if there was a better way?"
- "Have you ever wondered why...?"

**Replace with statements:**
- "There was a better way."
- "I found a better approach."
- "The reason is..."

**Why:** Rhetorical questions are theatrical, not explanatory.

### ❌ Grand Conclusions

**Avoid:**
- "This will change everything"
- "This revolutionizes how we think about education"
- "The future of learning is here"

**Replace with grounded conclusions:**
- "This worked for 500 students; it might work for you"
- "This changed how I think about feedback"
- "This approach proved more effective in my context"

**Why:** Grand conclusions feel performative and undermine credibility.

## Tone Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

### 1. Conversational Test
- [ ] **Would I say this sentence out loud in a conversation?**
  - If no: Rewrite in natural language
  - If yes: Keep it

### 2. Evidence Test
- [ ] **Can I defend every claim with evidence or experience?**
  - Claims from experience: ✅
  - Claims from data: ✅
  - Claims without support: ❌ Remove or add support

### 3. Performance Test
- [ ] **Is anything here just to sound smart?**
  - Jargon for clarity: ✅
  - Jargon to impress: ❌ Remove
  - Complex sentence for precision: ✅
  - Complex sentence for style: ❌ Simplify

### 4. Interview Test
- [ ] **Would I stand by every sentence in an interview?**
  - Confident: ✅
  - Exaggerated: ❌ Revise
  - Uncertain but honest: ✅

## Good vs. Bad Examples

### Example 1: Stating a Lesson

**Bad:**
"We must fundamentally reimagine the paradigm of educational excellence by leveraging technology to facilitate transformative learning experiences."

**Good:**
"After teaching 500 students, I learned that clarity beats cleverness. Students need frameworks for thinking, not more content to memorize."

**Why better:**
- Plain language ("clarity beats cleverness" vs "reimagine paradigm")
- Concrete evidence (500 students)
- Specific insight (frameworks vs content)

### Example 2: Describing an Outcome

**Bad:**
"Our revolutionary approach achieved exponential growth and game-changing results."

**Good:**
"Retention jumped from 15% to 40% weekly active users after we prioritized speed over comprehensiveness."

**Why better:**
- Specific metrics (15% → 40%)
- No hype language
- Clear cause and effect

### Example 3: Admitting Uncertainty

**Bad:**
"This always works. Everyone should adopt this approach immediately."

**Good:**
"This worked for my students (ages 16-18, HSC English). I'm not sure if it generalizes to other subjects or age groups, but the principle might transfer."

**Why better:**
- Honest about scope
- Specific context
- Careful about generalization

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Broad

**Problem:** "Education is broken. We need to rethink everything."

**Fix:** Start specific. "After teaching 500 students, I noticed..."

### Mistake 2: Using Jargon Unnecessarily

**Problem:** "We leveraged AI to optimize pedagogical outcomes."

**Fix:** "I used AI to give students faster, better feedback."

### Mistake 3: Making Claims Without Evidence

**Problem:** "This approach works for everyone."

**Fix:** "This worked for my 500 students. It might work for you if..."

### Mistake 4: Hedging Too Much

**Problem:** "I think that maybe perhaps possibly this might work sometimes."

**Fix:** "This worked in my experience. I'm not sure if it generalizes."

**Note:** Be honest about uncertainty, but don't hedge every sentence.

## Style Examples by Section

### Intro Paragraphs

**Good:**
"After teaching 500 HSC English students, I learned that frameworks trump content. This realization changed how I teach—and how I built MarkPoint."

**Bad:**
"In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, we face unprecedented challenges. What if there was a better way? I'm going to share my revolutionary approach."

**Why good intro works:**
- Starts with evidence (500 students)
- States insight clearly
- Connects to action

### Section Headings

**Good:**
- "The Problem with Content-First Teaching"
- "What Worked: Teaching Frameworks"
- "Why This Matters Beyond Education"

**Bad:**
- "Reimagining Educational Paradigms"
- "The Future of Learning"
- "Disrupting Traditional Methods"

**Why good headings work:**
- Clear and specific
- Outline the argument
- Plain language

### Conclusions

**Good:**
"The lesson: frameworks beat content, but only if students have time to internalize them. Quality and focus matter more than quantity."

**Bad:**
"This revolutionary approach will transform education forever. The future starts now."

**Why good conclusion works:**
- Specific lesson
- Grounded limitation
- No grand claims

---

## Summary

**Write like you're explaining to a capable colleague:**
- Plain language, concrete examples
- Clear structure, honest uncertainty
- No buzzwords, no performance
- Everything defensible in interview

**Remember:**
The goal is not to impress—it's to make your thinking inspectable so employers can assess judgment quality.
