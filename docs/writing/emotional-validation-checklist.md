# Emotional Validation Checklist

**Epic 7 - Story 7.11**

## Purpose
Validate that writing produces the right emotional outcome: respect for your thinking, trust in your judgment, confidence in your capability—not skepticism about performance or substance.

---

## Core Principle

**The writing section should make employers think: "This person thinks clearly and honestly about their work."**

Not:
- "This person is trying to sound smart"
- "This person writes a lot but says little"
- "This person is performing, not explaining"

---

## Pre-Launch Review

Before publishing any essay, check for these emotional signals:

### 1. Would I Discuss This Confidently in an Interview?

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I defend every claim with evidence or experience?
- Am I comfortable being challenged on this?
- Would I reference this essay in a job interview?
- Do I believe what I've written?

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Confident: "Yes, I'd happily discuss this for 30 minutes"
- ✅ Grounded: "I have specific examples ready"
- ✅ Honest: "I've acknowledged what I don't know"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Defensive: "Well, it's complicated..."
- ❌ Vague: "I can't remember specific examples"
- ❌ Exaggerated: "I overstated things for impact"

### 2. Is Anything Here Just for Show?

**Ask yourself:**
- Did I include jargon to sound smart?
- Are there buzzwords or performance language?
- Is anything here designed to impress rather than explain?
- Would this be clearer if I explained it to a friend?

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Clear: "A friend would understand this"
- ✅ Honest: "I'm explaining, not performing"
- ✅ Simple: "I used the simplest words that work"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Complex: "I used complex language to sound smart"
- ❌ Jargony: "I included buzzwords unnecessarily"
- ❌ Performative: "I'm trying to impress"

### 3. Does This Add Distinct Signal?

**Ask yourself:**
- Does this show how I think in a new way?
- Is this redundant with other essays I've written?
- Will employers understand me better after reading this?
- Does this strengthen or weaken my overall narrative?

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Distinct: "This reveals something new about my thinking"
- ✅ Additive: "This complements my other essays"
- ✅ Signal: "Employers will assess my judgment better"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Redundant: "I've said this before in another essay"
- ❌ Noise: "This doesn't add to the narrative"
- ❌ Diluting: "This might weaken my other essays"

---

## External Validation Process

After pre-launch review passes, get external validation.

### 1. Select Test Readers (3-5 people)

**Choose people who:**
- Don't know the full context of your work
- Will be honest, not just supportive
- Represent different backgrounds
- Can assess clarity and tone

**Avoid:**
- Close friends who'll be overly positive
- People in your exact domain (they'll fill in gaps)
- Anyone who might just say "looks good"

### 2. Ask Specific Questions

Send the essay with these questions:

**Question 1: What Emotions Did You Feel Reading This?**

**Expected answers:**
- ✅ Respect for your thinking process
- ✅ Trust in your judgment

**Question 3: Would This Make You More or Less Likely to Hire Me? Why?**

**Expected answers:**
- ✅ More likely: "Shows clear thinking"

- ❌ Neutral: "Doesn't tell me much about capabilities"

**Question 4: What Raised Doubts or Skepticism?**

**Expected answers:**
- ✅ "Nothing significant"
- ✅ "I wanted more detail on [specific thing]" (addressable)
- ✅ "I wonder about [edge case]" (you addressed this in essay)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "The grand claims at the end"
- ❌ "Too much jargon, hard to follow"
- ❌ "Not sure if this actually happened or is hypothetical"
- ❌ "Sounds like you're overselling"

### 3. Analyze Feedback

**If 3+ readers give expected answers:**
- ✅ Essay passes external validation
- Proceed to publication

**If 2+ readers raise red flags:**
- ❌ Essay needs revision
- Address specific concerns
- Run by fresh readers before publishing

**If feedback is mixed:**
- Identify common threads

## Interview Simulation

## The Trust Test

After completing all validation, ask this final question:

### Would This Essay Increase or Decrease an Employer's Trust in Me?

**Increase trust if:**
- ✅ Shows clear thinking process
- ✅ Demonstrates honesty about constraints
- ✅ Reveals independent judgment
- ✅ Grounded in real experience
- ✅ Admits uncertainty where appropriate

**Decrease trust if:**
- ❌ Contains performance language or buzzwords
- ❌ Makes grand claims without evidence
- ❌ Seems defensive or makes excuses
- ❌ Too abstract or theoretical

- ❌ Lacks concrete examples

**Neutral (doesn't add signal) if:**
