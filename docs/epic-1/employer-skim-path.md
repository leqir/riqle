# employer skim path: 30-45 second comprehension

> **goal:** employer lands on homepage → understands identity → sees proof → finds next step → all in under 45 seconds
> **tone:** factual. grounded. no fluff.

---

## primary path (default journey)

```
home → work → (writing or startups) → contact
```

**reasoning:**

- employers want to see **what you've built** first (work)
- depth comes from **thinking** (writing) or **ownership** (startups)
- action ends with **contact** if interested

---

## homepage skim layout (scroll 1: 0-100vh)

### above fold (first screen)

**1. identity (who)**

```
nathanael / riqle
```

- lowercase. chalk typography.
- no job title. no buzzwords.
- just name + brand identity.

**2. positioning (what)**

```
student → tutor → builder → founder
```

- trajectory in 4 words.
- shows non-linear path.
- honest progression.

**3. proof anchors (why believe you)**

maximum 3 anchors. quantified. factual.

```
built markpoint (startup with [X] users)
taught 500+ students to band 6 in hsc english
ships production code daily
```

**rules for proof anchors:**

- quantified where possible ("500+ students" not "many students")
- active voice ("ships" not "has shipped")
- outcome-focused ("band 6" not "helped students")

**4. routing ctas (where next)**

```
[view work] [read writing]
```

**primary:** view work (shows execution capability)
**secondary:** read writing (shows thinking depth)
**tertiary:** resources (present in nav, not dominant here)

**button styling:**

- chalk borders (hand-drawn)
- lowercase text
- neon cyan glow on hover
- no urgency language

## homepage skim layout (scroll 2: 100vh-200vh)

```
[essay card]
title: building in public: lessons from markpoint
excerpt: [2-3 lines showing judgment/insight]
read time: 8 min
[read essay →]
```

**visual hierarchy:**

- project cards: hand-drawn borders, imperfections (torn corner, tape)
- essay cards: notebook paper texture, pencil underlines
- korean annotations: "노력" (effort) near work, "진실" (truth) near writing

```

**aesthetic:**

- minimal
- large chalk-style email
- hand-drawn envelope icon
- no gatekeeping, no lead capture

## skim path timing breakdown

**goal: 30-45 seconds total**

| screen            | time       | what happens                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| homepage scroll 1 | 10-15s     | read name, positioning, 3 proof anchors, choose CTA |
| homepage scroll 2 | 5-10s      | skim featured project + essay                       |
| work page         | 10-15s     | scan 3-5 project cards, pick one                    |
| project detail    | 5-10s      | read outcome, tech, decide if interested            |
| contact           | 5s         | note email or fill form                             |
| **total**         | **35-55s** | **within target range**                             |

---

## information density per screen

**principle:** show enough to compel, not overwhelm.

### homepage (scroll 1)

- **max 7-10 items:**
  - name
  - positioning line
  - 3 proof anchors
  - 2 CTAs
  - nav menu (always visible)

### work page

- **max 5 featured projects above fold**
- each card: 4-5 pieces of info (title, description, outcome, tech, CTA)
- "see all" link if more projects exist

### writing page

- **max 3 featured essays above fold**
- each card: 4 pieces of info (title, excerpt, read time, CTA)

---

## scan patterns optimized

### f-pattern (how employers actually scan)

**homepage:**

```
[name / riqle] ────────────── [nav menu]
student → tutor → builder → founder

built markpoint ──────────────
taught 500+ students ─────────
ships production code ────────

[view work] [read writing]
```

employer eyes move:

1. horizontal: name + nav
2. horizontal: positioning line
3. vertical: scan proof anchors (left-aligned)
4. horizontal: CTAs

**work page:**

```
work ──────────────────────────

[project 1] [project 2] [project 3]
   ↓           ↓           ↓
 scan       scan        scan
 title      title       title
```

grid layout supports horizontal scanning of multiple projects simultaneously.

---

## progressive disclosure strategy

**scroll 1: clarity**

- who you are
- what you do
- where to go

**scroll 2: proof**

- best work example
- best essay example

**scroll 3+: texture** (optional)

- additional context
- footer with full nav
- korean annotations become more visible

**deep pages: full depth**

- complete case studies
- technical details
- learnings and process

---

## mobile skim path adjustments

**goal: same comprehension, adapted to mobile**

**homepage mobile (vertical scroll):**

```
[nav toggle ☰]

nathanael / riqle

student → tutor →
builder → founder

built markpoint
(startup with X users)

taught 500+ students
to band 6

ships production code
daily

[view work]
[read writing]
```

**key changes:**

- vertical stack (no columns)
- larger touch targets (min 44px)
- hamburger nav (no horizontal menu)
- same content, different layout

---

## employer personas and paths

### persona 1: startup founder/cto

**wants to see:** execution capability, ownership mindset
**path:** home → work (markpoint) → startups → contact
**time:** 30-40s

### persona 2: agency/studio hiring

**wants to see:** technical depth, design sense
**path:** home → work (riqle, client projects) → writing → contact
**time:** 35-45s

### persona 3: education company

**wants to see:** teaching proof, domain expertise
**path:** home → writing (teaching essays) → resources → contact
**time:** 40-50s

**all paths:** ≤ 3 clicks to best proof

---

## what NOT to show above fold

**banned from homepage scroll 1:**

- detailed case studies (save for work pages)
- full bio (save for about page)
- product pitches (resources page only)
- testimonials (unless ultra-brief)
- social media feeds
- blog archives
- photo galleries

**reasoning:**

- employer has 10-15 seconds to decide if you're credible
- clutter = confusion = bounce
- depth exists, but on demand

---

## skim path testing checklist

**before launch, test:**

- [ ] can employer understand identity in 15 seconds?
- [ ] are 3 proof anchors immediately visible?
- [ ] is best proof ≤ 3 clicks from homepage?
- [ ] does work page show 3-5 projects above fold?
- [ ] is contact always 1 click away (nav)?
- [ ] does homepage feel calm (not overwhelming)?
- [ ] are CTAs clear verbs ("view work" not "learn more")?
- [ ] does mobile version preserve information hierarchy?
- [ ] can user complete skim in 30-45 seconds?
- [ ] does resources page exist but not dominate?

**test method:**

- show homepage to someone for 10 seconds
- hide it
- ask: "what does this person do? why believe them?"
- if they can answer → skim path works

---

## aesthetic integration with skim path

**korean study room vibe supports scanning:**

**desk lamp glow:**

- draws eye to proof anchors (brightest area)
- creates focal point for CTAs

**chalk typography:**

- headings pop (hand-drawn contrast)
- body text readable (apple sf clean)

**neon accents:**

- cyan: guides to actions (CTAs, links)
- green: validates outcomes (metrics, results)
- pink: warns (use sparingly)

**desk objects:**

- don't obstruct scan path
- sit in margins/backgrounds
- enhance atmosphere without blocking info

**korean annotations:**

- opacity 25-30% (felt, not noticed)
- positioned in dead space
- never overlap critical content

**status:** skim path defined. ready for wireframing + implementation.
**test:** can employer understand you in 45 seconds? yes.
