# Analytics Success Questions

## Primary Questions

### 1. Do employers understand me quickly?

**Why this matters:** The homepage must compress identity effectively in 30-45 seconds.

**Metrics:**

- Homepage bounce rate (< 70% is good)
- Time to first interaction (< 5s is good)
- Click-through to Work/Writing (> 30% is good)

**Interpretation:**

- ✅ Low bounce + quick routing = successful identity compression
- ❌ High bounce + no interaction = unclear positioning

**Actions if failing:**

- Review homepage copy
- Test with real employers
- Simplify above-fold content

### 2. Which proof surfaces are working?

**Why this matters:** Proof must resonate without overwhelming.

**Metrics:**

- Project page views (relative to homepage visits)
- Time on project pages (> 60s = engaged)
- Writing scroll depth (> 50% = engaged)
- Writing completion rate (> 25% = resonant)

**Interpretation:**

- ✅ High dwell time = credibility resonance
- ❌ Low engagement = weak framing or wrong placement

**Actions if failing:**

- Review project framing
- Check content quality
- Simplify navigation

### 3. Is commerce functioning healthily?

**Why this matters:** Commerce must feel safe, not aggressive.

**Metrics:**

- Conversion rate (directional only, not optimized)
- Refund rate (< 5% is healthy)
- Support requests per order (< 10% is healthy)
- Repeat access events (indicates value delivered)

**Interpretation:**

- ✅ Low refunds + low support = trust intact
- ⚠️ High conversion is NOT the primary success signal

**Actions if failing:**

- Review checkout clarity
- Check access delivery
- Improve post-purchase communication

### 4. Is anything broken?

**Why this matters:** Reliability failures must be caught quickly.

**Metrics:**

- Checkout failure rate (< 1% is healthy)
- Webhook failure rate (< 1% is healthy)
- Access recovery usage (< 10% is healthy)
- Error rate (< 0.1% is healthy)

**Interpretation:**

- Spikes indicate reliability issues, not marketing issues

**Actions if failing:**

- Check error logs immediately
- Review failed jobs
- Test critical flows
